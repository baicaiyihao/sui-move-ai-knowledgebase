## Why Sui?

### Sui is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform

![Decorative visual](/img/index/blocks.png)

Unmatched scalability, instant settlement

A safe smart contract language accessible to mainstream developers

Ability to define rich and composable on-chain assets

Better user experience for web3 apps

Scalability

Sui scales horizontally to meet the demands of applications. Network capacity grows in proportion to the increase in Sui validators' processing power by adding workers, resulting in low gas fees even during high network traffic. This scalability characteristic is in sharp contrast to other blockchains with rigid bottlenecks.

Move

Move design prevents issues such as reentrancy vulnerabilities, poison tokens, and spoofed token approvals that attackers have leveraged to steal millions on other platforms. The emphasis on safety and expressivity provides a more straightforward transition from web 2.0 to web3 for developers, without the need to understand the intricacies of the underlying infrastructure.

On-chain assets

Rich on-chain assets enable new applications and economies based on utility without relying solely on artificial scarcity. Developers can implement dynamic NFTs that you can upgrade, bundle, and group in an application-specific manner, such as changes in avatars and customizable items based on gameplay. This capability delivers stronger in-game economies as NFT behavior gets fully reflected on-chain, making NFTs more valuable and delivering more engaging feedback loops.

Built for Web3

Sui aims to be the most accessible smart contract platform, empowering developers to create great user experiences in web3. To usher in the next billion users, Sui empowers developers with various tools to take advantage of the power of the Sui blockchain. The Sui Development Kit (SDK) will enable developers to build without boundaries.

# concepts
# Sui Concepts Overview

Sui is different than other blockchains. The concepts explored in this section provide a background to the Sui blockchain and web3 in general.

## Move[​](#move "Direct link to Move")

## Move overview

Move is an open source language for writing safe packages to manipulate on-chain objects

## Package upgrades

Sui provides a method of upgrading your packages while still retaining their immutable properties.

## Objects[​](#objects "Direct link to Objects")

## Object Model

Everything on the Sui blockchain is an object, with metadata, type of ownership, and a referencing scheme.

## Dynamic Fields

Dynamic fields and dynamic object fields on Sui are added and removed dynamically, affect gas only when accessed, and store heterogeneous values.

## Transfer to Object

On Sui, you can transfer objects to objects in the same way you can transfer objects to addresses.

## Cryptography[​](#cryptography "Direct link to Cryptography")

## zkLogin

zkLogin is a Sui primitive that enables you to send transactions from a Sui address using an OAuth credential, without publicly linking the two.

## Transaction authentication

Transaction security is arguably the most important feature of a blockchain. Sui provides multiple features to secure your transactions, whether on chain or off.

## Tokenomics[​](#tokenomics "Direct link to Tokenomics")

## SUI token

The native asset on Sui is called SUI. The coin uses the capitalized version of SUI to distinguish the coin from the Sui network.

## Gas in Sui

A Sui transaction must pay for both the computational cost of execution and the long-term cost of storing the objects a transaction creates or mutates.

## Storage fund

Sui includes an efficient and sustainable economic mechanism for financing data storage, which is important given the ability of Sui to store arbitrarily large amounts of on-chain data.

# standards
# Sui Standards Overview

Standards on the Sui blockchain are features, frameworks, or apps that you can extend or customize.

## Closed Loop Token

Using the Closed-Loop Token standard, you can limit the applications that can use the token and set up custom policies for transfers, spends, and conversions. The `sui::token` module in the Sui framework defines the standard.

## Coin

The Sui Coin standard enables you to create a broad range of fungible tokens on the Sui network to satisfy a number of use cases. The Coin standed on Sui is equivalent to the ERC-20 technical standard on Ethereum.

## Deepbook

A central limit order book that offers features and functionality for marketplaces on Sui. Token exchanges leveraging the layer can feature transparency, a full range of trading options, and customer privacy.

## Kiosk

Kiosk is a decentralized system for commerce applications on Sui. Kiosk is a part of the Sui framework, native to the system, and available to everyone.

## Kiosk Apps

Kiosk apps are a way to extend the functionality of Sui Kiosk while keeping the core functionality intact. You can develop apps to add new features to a kiosk without having to modify the core code or move the assets elsewhere.

## Sui Object Display

The Sui Object Display standard is a template engine that enables on-chain management of off-chain representation (display) for a type.

## Wallet Standard

The Wallet standard defines how wallets can automatically be discovered and interacted with from dApps.

# coin
# Coin Standard

The Coin standard is the technical standard used for smart contracts on Sui for creating coins on the Sui blockchain. The standardization of coin creation on Sui means that wallets, exchanges, and other smart contracts can manage coins created on Sui the same as they manage SUI, without any additional processing logic.

See [Sui Tokenomics](/concepts/tokenomics) to learn more about the SUI native coin and its use on the Sui network.

Although coins on Sui follow the Coin standard, they can offer specialized abilities. For example, you can create a regulated token that allows its creator to add specific addresses to a deny list, so that the identified addresses cannot use the token as inputs to transactions.

See the [coin module](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/docs/sui-framework/coin.md) documentation for all available options when creating a coin-type token on Sui.

## Fungible tokens[​](#fungible-tokens "Direct link to Fungible tokens")

In the Sui blockchain ecosystem, the `Coin<T>` type represents open-loop fungible tokens (see `Token<T>` for closed-loop tokens). Coins are denominated by their type parameter, `T`, which is also associated with metadata (like name, symbol, decimal precision, and so on) that applies to all instances of `Coin<T>`. The `sui::coin` module exposes an interface over `Coin<T>` that treats it as fungible, meaning that a unit of `T` held in one instance of `Coin<T>` is interchangeable with any other unit of `T`, much like how traditional fiat currencies operate.

info

The documentation refers to fungible tokens created on Sui using the Coin standard as "coins". For fungible tokens created on Sui using the [Closed-Loop Token standard](/standards/closed-loop-token), the documentation uses the term "tokens". In practice, the terms for both these objects are often interchangeable.

## Treasury capability[​](#treasury-capability "Direct link to Treasury capability")

When you create a coin using the `coin::create_currency` function, the publisher of the smart contract that creates the coin receives a `TreasuryCap` object. The `TreasuryCap` object is required to mint new coins or to burn current ones. Consequently, only addresses that have access to this object are able to maintain the coin supply on the Sui network.

The `TreasuryCap` object is transferable, so a third party can take over the management of a coin that you create if you transfer the `TreasuryCap`. After transferring the capability, however, you are no longer able to mint and burn tokens yourself.

## Regulated coins[​](#regulated-coins "Direct link to Regulated coins")

The Coin standard includes the ability to create regulated coins. To create a regulated coin, you use the `coin::create_regulated_currency` function (which uses the `coin::create_currency` function itself), but which also returns a `DenyCap` capability. The `DenyCap` capability allows the bearer to maintain a list of addresses that aren't allowed to use the token.

tip

The [regulated-coin-sample repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/regulated-coin-sample) provides an example of regulated coin creation.

### DenyList object[​](#denylist-object "Direct link to DenyList object")

The list of addresses that aren't able to use a particular regulated coin is held within a system-created `DenyList` shared object. If you have access to the `DenyCap`, then you can use the `coin::deny_list_add` and `coin::deny_list_remove` functions to add and remove addresses. You can also use the `coin::deny_list_contains` function to check if an address is already on the list.

## Coin metadata[​](#coin-metadata "Direct link to Coin metadata")

Each coin you create includes metadata that describes it. Typically, smart contracts freeze this object upon creation using the `transfer::public_freeze_object` function because the metadata for coins should almost never change. Regulated coins freeze the metadata they create automatically.

Regular coins using the Coin standard include a `CoinMetadata` object. As mentioned previously, regulated coins build on top of the same procedure that creates regular coins, so they receive the same metadata object in addition to a `RegulatedCoinMetadata` object that includes deny list information.

The fields of the metadata objects include the following:

#### CoinMetadata[​](#coinmetadata "Direct link to CoinMetadata")

Name| Description  
---|---  
`id`| The object ID of the metadata for the token.  
`decimals`| The number of decimals the token uses. If you set this field to `3`, then a token of value `1000` would display as `1.000`.  
`name`| Name of the coin.  
`symbol`| Symbol for the coin. This might be the same as `name`, but is typically fewer than five all capital letters. For example, `SUI` is the `symbol` for the native coin on Sui but its `name` is also `SUI`.  
`description`| A short description to describe the token.  
`icon_url`| The URL for the token's icon, used for display in wallets, explorers, and other apps.  
  
#### RegulatedCoinMetadata[​](#regulatedcoinmetadata "Direct link to RegulatedCoinMetadata")

Name| Description  
---|---  
`id`| The ID of the metadata object for the regulated token.  
`coin_metadata_object`| The ID of the underlying metadata object (`CoinMetadata`) for the regulated token.  
`deny_cap_object`| The ID of the token's `DenyCap` object, which is necessary to maintain the deny list entries that controls who can and cannot use the token.  
  
## Minting and burning coins[​](#minting-and-burning-coins "Direct link to Minting and burning coins")

The `coin` module provides the logic for creating and destroying coins on the Sui network (as long as you own the associated `TreasuryCap`). These functions are the same for all coins and each requires the `TreasuryCap` as an input.

### Mint[​](#mint "Direct link to Mint")

Use the `coin::mint` function to create new tokens. The signature for the function is:

```

    
    
    publicfunmint<T>(cap: &mut coin::TreasuryCap<T>,value: u64,ctx: &mut tx_context::TxContext): coin::Coin<T>
```

The signature shows that a `Coin<T>` results from calling the function with a `TreasuryCap`, value for the coin created, and the transaction context. The function updates the total supply in `TreasuryCap` automatically. Upon display, the coin `value` respects the `decimals` value in the metadata. So, if you supply 1000000 as the coin `value` that has a `decimal` value of `6`, the coin's value displays as `1.000000`.

### Burn[​](#burn "Direct link to Burn")

Use the `coin::burn` function to destroy current tokens. The signature for the function is:

```

    
    
    publicentryfunburn<T>(cap: &mut coin::TreasuryCap<T>,c: coin::Coin<T>): u64
```

The signature shows that only the `TreasuryCap` and coin object you want to burn are necessary inputs, returning the amount by which the supply was decreased (value of the coin). The function does not allow you to burn more coins than are available in the supply.

## Adding and removing addresses to and from the deny list[​](#adding-and-removing-addresses-to-and-from-the-deny-list "Direct link to Adding and removing addresses to and from the deny list")

The deny list is only applicable to regulated coins. As mentioned previously, when you create a regulated coin you receive a `DenyCap` that authorizes the bearer to add and remove addresses from the system-created `DenyList` object. Any address on the list for your coin is unable to use the coin as an input to transactions.

### Add address to deny list[​](#add-address-to-deny-list "Direct link to Add address to deny list")

Use the `coin::deny_list_add` function to add the provided address to the deny list for your coin. The signature for the function is:

```

    
    
    publicfundeny_list_add<T>(deny_list: &mut deny_list::DenyList,_deny_cap: &mut coin::DenyCap<T>,addr: address,_ctx: &mut tx_context::TxContext)
```

When using this function, you provide the `DenyList` object (`0x403`), the `DenyCap` you receive on coin creation, the address to add to the list, and the transaction context. After using this function, the address you provide is unable to use your coin by the next epoch.

### Remove address from deny list[​](#remove-address-from-deny-list "Direct link to Remove address from deny list")

Use the `coin::deny_list_remove` function to remove addresses from the deny list for your coin. The signature for the function is:

```

    
    
    publicfundeny_list_remove<T>(deny_list: &mut deny_list::DenyList,_deny_cap: &mut coin::DenyCap<T>,addr: address,_ctx: &mut tx_context::TxContext)
```

When using this function, you provide the `DenyList` object (`0x403`), the `DenyCap` you receive on coin creation, the address to remove from the list, and the transaction context. If you try to remove an address that isn't on the list, you receive an `ENotFrozen` error and the function aborts. After calling this function, the address you provide is able to use your coin by the next epoch.

### Using an SDK[​](#using-an-sdk "Direct link to Using an SDK")

You can use either the TypeScript or Rust SDK to manipulate the addresses held in the `DenyList` for your coin. The following examples are based on the [regulated coin sample](https://github.com/MystenLabs/regulated-coin-sample).

  * TypeScript
  * Rust

```

    
    
    const tx =newTransaction();tx.moveCall({  target:`0x2::coin::deny_list_add`,  arguments:[    tx.object(<SUI-DENY-LIST-OBJECT-ID>),    tx.object(<DENY-CAP-ID>),    tx.pure.address(options.address),],  typeArguments:[<COIN-TYPE>],});
```

  * `<SUI-DENY-LIST-OBJECT-ID>` is `"0x403"`
  * `<DENY-CAP-ID>` is the object of type `DenyCap<REGULATED_COIN>` we received from publishing the contract
  * `options.address` is the address to ban
  * `<COIN-TYPE>` is `${PACKAGE-ID}::${MODULE-NAME}::${COIN-NAME}`, which is `${PACKAGE-ID}::regulated_coin::REGULATED_COIN` based on the example.

```

    
    
    letmut ptb =ProgrammableTransactionBuilder::new();let deny_list = ptb.obj(ObjectArg::SharedObject{  id: deny_list.0,  initial_shared_version: deny_list.1,  mutable:true,})?;let deny_cap = ptb.obj(ObjectArg::ImmOrOwnedObject(deny_cap))?;let address = ptb.pure(cmd.address())?;ptb.command(Command::move_call(SUI_FRAMEWORK_PACKAGE_ID,Identifier::from(COIN_MODULE_NAME),Identifier::from_str("deny_list_add".to_string())?,vec![<otw-type>],vec![deny_list, deny_cap, address],));let builder = ptb.finish();
```

  * `deny_list` is of type `(ObjectID, SequenceNumber)`. 
    * `ObjectID` is `0x403`.
    * `SequenceNumber` is the `initial_shared_version` of the `DenyList` singleton.
  * `deny_cap` is the `ObjectRef` (`(ObjectID, SequenceNumber, ObjectDigest)`) of the `DenyCap<REGULATED_COIN>` the publisher has received.
  * `otw_type` is the `TypeTag` created from `<PACKAGE_ID>::regulated_coin::REGULATED_COIN` type.
  * `cmd.address()` returns the address to ban as a `SuiAddress`.

## Query coin data[​](#query-coin-data "Direct link to Query coin data")

You can use the following functions to retrieve data from coins.

### Metadata[​](#metadata "Direct link to Metadata")

Use the following functions to get the values for the respective fields on the metadata object for coins.

Function| Signature  
---|---  
`get_decimals`| `public fun get_decimals<T>(metadata: &coin::CoinMetadata<T>): u8`  
`get_name`| `public fun get_name<T>(metadata: &coin::CoinMetadata<T>): string::String`  
`get_symbol`| `public fun get_symbol<T>(metadata: &coin::CoinMetadata<T>): ascii::String`  
`get_description`| `public fun get_description<T>(metadata: &coin::CoinMetadata<T>): string::String`  
`get_icon_url`| `public fun get_icon_url<T>(metadata: &coin::CoinMetadata<T>): option::Option<url::Url>`  
  
### Supply[​](#supply "Direct link to Supply")

Use the `coin::supply` function to get the current supply of a given coin.

### Check for address on deny list[​](#check-for-address-on-deny-list "Direct link to Check for address on deny list")

Use the `coin::deny_list_contains` function to check if an address exists on the deny list for your coin. The signature of the function is:

```

    
    
    publicfundeny_list_contains<T>(freezer: &deny_list::DenyList,addr: address): bool
```

The function returns `true` if the address is found on the coin's list, otherwise it returns `false`.

## Update coin metadata[​](#update-coin-metadata "Direct link to Update coin metadata")

If the `CoinMetadata` object was not frozen upon creation, you can use the following functions to update its values.

Each function signature is similar. Replace `<FUNCTION-NAME>` and `<ATTRIBUTE-TYPE>` with the values defined in the table to get the signature of each function:

```

    
    
    publicentryfun <FUNCTION-NAME><T>(_treasury: &coin::TreasuryCap<T>,metadata: &mut coin::CoinMetadata<T>, <ATTRIBUTE-TYPE>)
```

`<FUNCTION-NAME>`| `<ATTRIBUTE-TYPE>`  
---|---  
`update_name`| `name: string::String`  
`update_symbol`| `symbol: ascii::String`  
`update_description`| `description: string::String`  
`update_icon_url`| `url: ascii::String`  
  
info

`RegulatedCoinMetadata` is frozen upon creation, so there are no functions to update its data.

# closed-loop-token
# Closed-Loop Token

Using the Closed-Loop Token standard, you can limit the applications that can use the token and set up custom policies for transfers, spends, and conversions. The [`sui::token` module](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/docs/sui-framework/token.md) in the Sui framework defines the standard.

## Background and use cases[​](#background-and-use-cases "Direct link to Background and use cases")

The [Coin standard](/standards/coin) on Sui is an example of an open-loop system - coins are free-flowing, [wrappable](/concepts/object-ownership/wrapped), [freely transferable](/concepts/transfers/custom-rules#the-store-ability-and-transfer-rules) and you can store them in any application. The best real world analogy would be cash - hardly regulated and can be freely used and passed.

Some applications, however, require constraining the scope of the token to a specific purpose. For example, some applications might need a token that you can only use for a specific service, or that an authorized account can only use, or a token that you can block certain accounts from using. A real-world analogy would be a bank account - regulated, bank-controlled, and compliant with certain rules and policies.

## Difference with Coin[​](#difference-with-coin "Direct link to Difference with Coin")

Unlike Coin, which has `key + store` abilities and thus supports wrapping and public transfers, Token has only the `key` ability and cannot be wrapped, stored as a dynamic field, or freely transferred (unless there's a custom policy for that). Due to this restriction, Token **can only be owned by an account** and can't be stored in an application (however, it can be "spent" - see [Spending section](/standards/closed-loop-token/spending) section).

```

    
    
    // defined in `sui::coin`struct Coin<phantom T> haskey, store {id: UID, balance: Balance<T> }// defined in `sui::token`struct Token<phantom T> haskey {id: UID, balance: Balance<T> }
```

## Compliance and rules[​](#compliance-and-rules "Direct link to Compliance and rules")

You can set up any rules for transfers, spends, and conversions for the tokens you create. You specify these rules per action in the [TokenPolicy](/standards/closed-loop-token/token-policy). [Rules](/standards/closed-loop-token/rules) are custom programmable restrictions that you can use to implement any request authorization or validation logic.

For example, a policy can set a limit on a transfer - `X` tokens per operation; or require user verification before spending tokens; or allow spending tokens only on a specific service.

You can reuse rules across different policies and applications; and you can freely combine rules to create complex policies.

## Public actions[​](#public-actions "Direct link to Public actions")

Tokens have a set of public and protected actions that you can use to manage the token. Public actions are available to everyone and don't require any authorization. They have similar APIs to coins, but operate on the `Token` type:

  * `token::keep` - send a token to the transaction sender
  * `token::join` - join two tokens
  * `token::split` - split a token into two, specify the amount to split
  * `token::zero` - create an empty (zero balance) token
  * `token::destroy_zero` - destroy a token with zero balance

See [Coin Token Comparison](/standards/closed-loop-token/coin-token-comparison) for coin and token methods comparison.

## Protected actions[​](#protected-actions "Direct link to Protected actions")

Protected actions are ones that issue an [`ActionRequest`](/standards/closed-loop-token/action-request) - a hot-potato struct that must be resolved for the transaction to succeed. There are three main ways to resolve an `ActionRequest`, most common of which is via the [`TokenPolicy`](/standards/closed-loop-token/token-policy).

  * `token::transfer` - transfer a token to a specified address
  * `token::to_coin` - convert a token to a coin
  * `token::from_coin` - convert a coin to a token
  * `token::spend` - spend a token on a specified address

The previous methods are included in the base implementation, however it is possible to create `ActionRequest`s for custom actions.

## Token policy and rules[​](#token-policy-and-rules "Direct link to Token policy and rules")

Protected actions are disabled by default but you can enable them in a [`TokenPolicy`](/standards/closed-loop-token/token-policy). Additionally, you can set custom restrictions called [rules](/standards/closed-loop-token/rules) that a specific action must satisfy for it to succeed.

# Sui Kiosk

Kiosk is a decentralized system for commerce applications on Sui. It consists of `Kiosk` objects - shared objects owned by individual parties that store assets and allow listing them for sale as well as utilize custom trading functionality - for example, an auction. While being highly decentralized, Sui Kiosk provides a set of strong guarantees:

  * Kiosk owners retain ownership of their assets to the moment of purchase.
  * Creators set custom policies - sets of rules applied to every trade (such as pay royalty fee or do some arbitrary action X).
  * Marketplaces can index events the `Kiosk` object emits and subscribe to a single feed for on-chain asset trading.

Practically, Kiosk is a part of the Sui framework, and it is native to the system and available to everyone out of the box.

info

See the [Kiosk SDK documentation](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/kiosk) for examples of working with Kiosk using TypeScript.

## Sui Kiosk owners[​](#sui-kiosk-owners "Direct link to Sui Kiosk owners")

Anyone can create a Sui Kiosk. Ownership of a kiosk is determined by the owner of the `KioskOwnerCap`, a special object that grants full access to a single kiosk. As the owner, you can sell any asset with a type (T) that has a shared `TransferPolicy` available, or you can use a kiosk to store assets even without a shared policy. You can’t sell or transfer any assets from your kiosk that do not have an associated transfer policy available.

To sell an item, if there is an existing transfer policy for the type (T), you just add your assets to your kiosk and then list them. You specify an offer amount when you list an item. Anyone can then purchase the item for the amount of SUI specified in the listing. The associated transfer policy determines what the buyer can do with the purchased asset.

A kiosk owner can:

  * Place and take items
  * List items for sale
  * Add and remove Extensions
  * Withdraw profits from sales
  * Borrow and mutate owned assets
  * Access the full set of trading tools, such as auctions, lotteries, and collection bidding

## Sui Kiosk for buyers[​](#sui-kiosk-for-buyers "Direct link to Sui Kiosk for buyers")

A buyer is a party that purchases (or - more generally - receives) items from kiosks, anyone on the network can be a buyer (and, for example, a kiosk owner at the same time).

**Benefits:**

  * Buyers get access to global liquidity and can get the best offer
  * Buyers can place bids on collections through their kiosks
  * Most buyer actions performed in kiosks clean up seller objects, which results in free (gas-less) actions

**Responsibilities:**

  * Buyer is the party that pays the fees if they're set in the policy
  * Buyer must follow the rules set by creators or a transaction won't succeed

**Guarantees:**

  * When using a custom trading logic such as an auction, the items are guaranteed to be unchanged until the trade is complete

## Sui Kiosk for marketplaces[​](#sui-kiosk-for-marketplaces "Direct link to Sui Kiosk for marketplaces")

As a marketplace operator, you can implement Sui Kiosk to watch for offers made in a collection of kiosks and display them on a marketplace site. You can also implement a custom system using Kiosk extensions (created by the community or third-parties). For example, marketplaces can use a `TransferPolicyCap` to implement application-specific transfer rules.

## Sui Kiosk for creators[​](#sui-kiosk-for-creators "Direct link to Sui Kiosk for creators")

As a creator, Sui Kiosk supports strong enforcement for transfer policies and associated rules to protect assets and enforce asset ownership. Sui Kiosk gives creators more control over their creations, and puts creators and owners in control of how their works can be used.

Creator is a party that creates and controls the TransferPolicy for a single type. For example, the authors of SuiFrens are the Creators of the `SuiFren<Capy>` type and act as creators in the Kiosk ecosystem. Creators set the policy, but they might also be the first sellers of their assets through a kiosk.

**Creators can:**

  * Set any rules for trades
  * Set multiple ways ("tracks") of rules
  * Enable or disable trades at any moment with a policy
  * Enforce policies (like royalties) on all trades
  * Perform a primary sale of their assets through a kiosk

All of the above is effective immediately and globally.

**Creators cannot:**

  * Take or modify items stored in someone else's kiosk
  * Restrict taking items from kiosks if the "locking" rule was not set in the policy

## Sui Kiosk guarantees[​](#sui-kiosk-guarantees "Direct link to Sui Kiosk guarantees")

Sui Kiosk provides a set of guarantees that Sui enforces through smart contracts. These guarantees include:

  * Every trade in Sui Kiosk requires a `TransferPolicy` resolution. This gives creators control over how their assets can be traded.
  * True ownership, which means that only a kiosk owner can take, list, borrow, or modify the assets added to their kiosk. This is similar to how single-owner objects work on Sui.
  * Strong policy enforcement, for example Royalty policies, that lets creators enable or disable policies at any time that applies to all trades on the platform for objects with that policy attached.
  * Changes to a `TransferPolicy` apply instantly and globally.

In practice, these guarantees mean that:

  * When you list an item for sale, no one can modify it or take it from the kiosk.
  * When you define a `PurchaseCap`, an item remains locked and you can’t modify or take the item from the kiosk unless the trade uses or returns the `PurchaseCap`.
  * You can remove any rule at any time (as the owner).
  * You can disable any extension at any time (as the owner).
  * The state of an extension state is always accessible to the extension.

### Asset states in Sui Kiosk[​](#asset-states "Direct link to Asset states in Sui Kiosk")

Sui Kiosk is a shared object that can store heterogeneous values, such as different sets of asset collectibles. When you add an asset to your kiosk, it has one of the following states:

  * PLACED - an item placed in the kiosk using the `kiosk::place` function. The kiosk owner can withdraw it and use it directly, borrow it (mutably or immutably), or list an item for sale.
  * LOCKED - an item placed in the kiosk using the `kiosk::lock` function. You can’t withdraw a Locked item from a kiosk, but you can borrow it mutably and list it for sale. Any item placed in a kiosk that has an associated kiosk lock policy have a LOCKED state.
  * LISTED - an item in the kiosk that is listed for sale using the `kiosk::list` or `kiosk::place_and_list` functions. You can’t modify an item while listed, but you can borrow it immutably or delist it, which returns it to its previous state.
  * LISTED EXCLUSIVELY - an item placed or locked in the kiosk by an extension that calls the `kiosk::list_with_purchase_cap` function. Only the kiosk owner can approve calling the function. The owner can only borrow it immutably. The extension must provide the functionality to delist / unlock the asset, or it might stay locked forever. Given that this action is explicitly performed by the owner - it is the responsibility of the owner to choose verified and audited extensions to use.

When someone purchases an asset from a kiosk, the asset leaves the kiosk and ownership transfers to the buyer’s address.

## Open a Sui Kiosk[​](#open-a-sui-kiosk "Direct link to Open a Sui Kiosk")

To use a Sui Kiosk, you must create one and have the `KioskOwnerCap` that matches the `Kiosk` object. You can create a new kiosk using a single transaction by calling the `kiosk::default` function. The function creates and shares a `Kiosk`, and transfers the `KioskOwnerCap` to your address.

### Create a Sui Kiosk using programmable transaction blocks[​](#create-a-sui-kiosk-using-programmable-transaction-blocks "Direct link to Create a Sui Kiosk using programmable transaction blocks")

```

    
    
    let tx =newTransaction();tx.moveCall({target:'0x2::kiosk::default',});
```

### Create a Sui Kiosk using the Sui CLI[​](#create-a-sui-kiosk-using-the-sui-cli "Direct link to Create a Sui Kiosk using the Sui CLI")

tip

Beginning with the Sui `v1.24.1` [release](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/mainnet-v1.24.1), the `--gas-budget` flag is no longer required for CLI commands.

```

    
    
    sui client call \  --package 0x2 \  --module kiosk \  --function default \  --gas-budget 1000000000
```

### Create a Sui Kiosk with advanced options[​](#create-a-sui-kiosk-with-advanced-options "Direct link to Create a Sui Kiosk with advanced options")

For more advanced use cases, when you want to choose the storage model or perform an action right away, you can use the programmable transaction block (PTB) friendly function `kiosk::new`. Kiosk is designed to be shared. If you choose a different storage model, such as owned, your kiosk might not function as intended or not be accessible to other users. You can make sure your kiosk works by testing it on Sui Testnet.

### Create a Sui Kiosk with advanced options using programmable transaction blocks[​](#create-a-sui-kiosk-with-advanced-options-using-programmable-transaction-blocks "Direct link to Create a Sui Kiosk with advanced options using programmable transaction blocks")

```

    
    
    let tx =newTransaction();let[kiosk, kioskOwnerCap]= tx.moveCall({target:'0x2::kiosk::new',});tx.transferObjects([kioskOwnerCap], sender);tx.moveCall({target:'0x2::transfer::public_share_object',arguments:[kiosk],typeArguments:'0x2::kiosk::Kiosk',});
```

### Create a Sui Kiosk with advanced options using the SUI CLI[​](#create-a-sui-kiosk-with-advanced-options-using-the-sui-cli "Direct link to Create a Sui Kiosk with advanced options using the SUI CLI")

Sui CLI does not support PTBs and transaction chaining yet. You can use the `kiosk::default` function instead.

## Place items in and take items from your kiosk[​](#place-items-in-and-take-items-from-your-kiosk "Direct link to Place items in and take items from your kiosk")

As a kiosk owner, you can place any assets into your Sui Kiosk. You can take any item from your kiosk that is not currently listed for sale.

There's no limitations on which assets you can place in your kiosk. However, you can’t necessarily list and trade all of the items you place in your kiosk. The `TransferPolicy` associated with the type for the item determines whether you can trade it. To learn more, see the [Purchase items from a kiosk](#purchase) section.

### Place an item in your kiosk[​](#place-an-item-in-your-kiosk "Direct link to Place an item in your kiosk")

To place an item to the kiosk, the owner needs to call the `sui::kiosk::place` function on the `Kiosk` object and pass the `KioskOwnerCap` and the `Item` as arguments.

`ITEM_TYPE` in the following examples represents the full type of the item.

### Place an item using programmable transaction blocks[​](#place-an-item-using-programmable-transaction-blocks "Direct link to Place an item using programmable transaction blocks")

```

    
    
    let tx =newTransaction();let itemArg = tx.object('<ID>');let kioskArg = tx.object('<ID>');let kioskOwnerCapArg = tx.object('<ID>');tx.moveCall({target:'0x2::kiosk::place',arguments:[kioskArg, kioskOwnerCapArg, itemArg],typeArguments:['<ITEM_TYPE>'],});
```

### Place an item using the Sui CLI[​](#place-an-item-using-the-sui-cli "Direct link to Place an item using the Sui CLI")

```

    
    
    sui client call \  --package 0x2 \  --module kiosk \  --function place \  --args "<KIOSK_ID>" "<CAP_ID>" "<ITEM_ID>" \  --type-args "<ITEM_TYPE>" \  --gas-budget 1000000000
```

## Take items from a kiosk[​](#take-items-from-a-kiosk "Direct link to Take items from a kiosk")

To take an item from a kiosk you must be the kiosk owner. As the owner, call the `sui::kiosk::take` function on the `Kiosk` object, and pass the `KioskOwnerCap` and `ID` of the item as arguments.

`ITEM_TYPE` in the following examples represents the full type of the item.

### Take an item from a kiosk using programmable transaction blocks[​](#take-an-item-from-a-kiosk-using-programmable-transaction-blocks "Direct link to Take an item from a kiosk using programmable transaction blocks")

```

    
    
    let tx =newTransaction();let itemId = tx.pure.id('<ITEM_ID>');let kioskArg = tx.object('<ID>');let kioskOwnerCapArg = tx.object('<ID>');let item = tx.moveCall({target:'0x2::kiosk::take',arguments:[kioskArg, kioskOwnerCapArg, itemId],typeArguments:['<ITEM_TYPE>'],});
```

### Take an item from a kiosk using the Sui CLI[​](#take-an-item-from-a-kiosk-using-the-sui-cli "Direct link to Take an item from a kiosk using the Sui CLI")

The `kiosk::take` function is built to be PTB friendly and returns the asset. The Sui CLI does not yet support transaction chaining.

## Lock items in a kiosk[​](#lock-items-in-a-kiosk "Direct link to Lock items in a kiosk")

Some policies require that assets never get removed from a kiosk, such as for strong royalty enforcement. To support this, Sui Kiosk provides a locking mechanism. Locking is similar to placing except that you can't take a locked asset out of the kiosk.

To lock an asset in a kiosk, call the `sui::kiosk::lock` function. To ensure that you can later unlock the asset you must associate a `TransferPolicy` with the asset.

info

After you lock an asset, you must use `list` or `list_with_purchase_cap` functions to list it.

### Lock an item in a kiosk[​](#lock-an-item-in-a-kiosk "Direct link to Lock an item in a kiosk")

When you use the `lock` function, similar to using the `place` function, you specify the `KioskOwnerCap` and the `Item` as arguments. But to lock the item, you must also show the `TransferPolicy`.

`<ITEM_TYPE>` in the following examples represents the full type of the asset.

### Lock an item using programmable transaction blocks[​](#lock-an-item-using-programmable-transaction-blocks "Direct link to Lock an item using programmable transaction blocks")

```

    
    
    const tx =newTransaction();let kioskArg = tx.object('<ID>');let kioskOwnerCapArg = tx.object('<ID>');let itemArg = tx.object('<ID>');let transferPolicyArg = tx.object('<ID>');tx.moveCall({target:'0x2::kiosk::lock',arguments:[kioskArg, kioskOwnerCapArg, transferPolicyArg, itemArg],typeArguments:['<ITEM_TYPE>'],});
```

### Lock an item using the Sui CLI[​](#lock-an-item-using-the-sui-cli "Direct link to Lock an item using the Sui CLI")

```

    
    
    sui client call \  --package 0x2 \  --module kiosk \  --function lock \  --args "<KIOSK_ID>" "<CAP_ID>" "<TRANSFER_POLICY_ID>" "<ITEM_ID>" \  --type-args "<ITEM_TYPE>" \  --gas-budget 1000000000
```

## List and delist items from a kiosk[​](#list-and-delist-items-from-a-kiosk "Direct link to List and delist items from a kiosk")

Sui Kiosk provides basic trading functionality. As a kiosk owner, you can list assets for sale, and buyers can discover and purchase them. Sui Kiosk supports listing items by default with three primary functions:

  * `kiosk::list` - list an asset for sale for a fixed price
  * `kiosk::delist` - remove an existing listing
  * `kiosk::purchase` - purchase an asset listed for sale

Anyone on the network can purchase an item listed from a Sui Kiosk. To learn more about the purchase flow, see the [Purchase section](#purchase). To learn more about asset states and what can be done with a listed item, see the [Asset States](#asset-states) section.

### List an item from a kiosk[​](#list-an-item-from-a-kiosk "Direct link to List an item from a kiosk")

As a kiosk owner, you can use the `kiosk::list` function to list any asset you added to your kiosk. Include the item to sell and the list price as arguments. All listings on Sui are in SUI tokens. When you list an item, Sui emits a `kiosk::ItemListed` event that contains the kiosk ID, item ID, type of the item, and the list price.

### List an item using programmable transaction blocks[​](#list-an-item-using-programmable-transaction-blocks "Direct link to List an item using programmable transaction blocks")

```

    
    
    let tx =newTransaction();let kioskArg = tx.object('<ID>');let capArg = tx.object('<ID>');let itemId = tx.pure.id('<ID>');let itemType ='ITEM_TYPE';let priceArg = tx.pure.u64('<price>');// in MIST (1 SUI = 10^9 MIST)tx.moveCall({target:'0x2::kiosk::list',arguments:[kioskArg, capArg, itemId, priceArg],typeArguments:[itemType],});
```

### List an item using the Sui CLI[​](#list-an-item-using-the-sui-cli "Direct link to List an item using the Sui CLI")

```

    
    
    sui client call \  --package 0x2 \  --module kiosk \  --function list \  --args "<KIOSK_ID>" "<CAP_ID>" "<ITEM_ID>" "<PRICE>" \  --type-args "ITEM_TYPE" \  --gas-budget 1000000000
```

### Delist an item[​](#delist-an-item "Direct link to Delist an item")

As a kiosk owner you can use the `kiosk::delist` to delist any currently listed asset. Specify the item to delist as an argument.

When you delist an item, Sui returns to the kiosk owner the gas fees charged to list the item.

When you delist an item, Sui emits a `kiosk::ItemDelisted` event that contains the kiosk ID, item ID, and the type of the item.

### Delist an item using the programmable transaction blocks[​](#delist-an-item-using-the-programmable-transaction-blocks "Direct link to Delist an item using the programmable transaction blocks")

```

    
    
    let tx =newTransaction();let kioskArg = tx.object('<ID>');let capArg = tx.object('<ID>');let itemId = tx.pure.id('<ID>');let itemType ='ITEM_TYPE';tx.moveCall({target:'0x2::kiosk::delist',arguments:[kioskArg, capArg, itemId],typeArguments:[itemType],});
```

### Delist an item using the Sui CLI[​](#delist-an-item-using-the-sui-cli "Direct link to Delist an item using the Sui CLI")

```

    
    
    sui client call \  --package 0x2 \  --module kiosk \  --function delist \  --args "<KIOSK_ID>" "<CAP_ID>" "<ITEM_ID>" \  --type-args "ITEM_TYPE" \  --gas-budget 1000000000
```

## Purchase an item from a kiosk[​](#purchase "Direct link to Purchase an item from a kiosk")

Anyone that has an address on the Sui network can purchase an item listed from a Sui Kiosk. To purchase an item, you can use the `kiosk::purchase` function. Specify the item to purchase and pay the list price set by the kiosk owner.

You can discover the items listed on the network with the `kiosk::ItemListed` event.

When you use the `kiosk::purchase` function, it returns the purchased asset and the `TransferRequest` for the type associated with the asset. To complete the purchase, you must meet the terms defined in the `TransferPolicy` applied to the asset.

## Borrow an item from a kiosk[​](#borrow-an-item-from-a-kiosk "Direct link to Borrow an item from a kiosk")

As a kiosk owner, you can access an asset placed or locked in a kiosk without taking the asset from the kiosk. You can always borrow the asset immutably. Whether you can mutably borrow an asset depends on the state of the asset. For example, you can’t borrow a listed asset because you can’t modify it while listed. The functions available include:

  * `kiosk::borrow` - returns an immutable reference to the asset
  * `kiosk::borrow_mut` - returns a mutable reference to the asset
  * `kiosk::borrow_val` - a PTB-friendly version of `borrow_mut`, which allows you to take an asset and place it back in the same transaction.

### Immutable borrow[​](#immutable-borrow "Direct link to Immutable borrow")

You can always borrow an asset from a kiosk immutably. You can use the `kiosk::borrow` function to borrow an asset, however, it is not possible to use references within a programmable transaction block. To access the asset you must use a published module (function).

### Immutably borrow an asset using Sui Move[​](#immutably-borrow-an-asset-using-sui-move "Direct link to Immutably borrow an asset using Sui Move")

```

    
    
    module examples::immutable_borrow {usesui::object::ID;usesui::kiosk::{Self, Kiosk, KioskOwnerCap};publicfunimmutable_borrow_example<T>(self: &Kiosk, cap: &KioskOwnerCap, item_id: ID): &T {    kiosk::borrow(self, cap, item_id)  }}
```

### Mutable borrow with borrow_mut[​](#mutable-borrow-with-borrow_mut "Direct link to Mutable borrow with borrow_mut")

You can mutably borrow an asset from a kiosk if it is not listed. You can use the `kiosk::borrow_mut` function to mutably borrow an asset. However, it is not possible to use references within a PTB, so to access the mutably borrowed asset you must use a published module (function).

### Mutably borrow an asset using Sui Move[​](#mutably-borrow-an-asset-using-sui-move "Direct link to Mutably borrow an asset using Sui Move")

```

    
    
    module examples::mutable_borrowusesui::object::ID;usesui::kiosk::{Self, Kiosk, KioskOwnerCap};publicfunmutable_borrow_example<T>(self: &mut Kiosk, cap: &KioskOwnerCap, item_id: ID  ): &mut T {    kiosk::borrow_mut(self, cap, item_id)  }}
```

### Mutable borrow with borrow_val[​](#mutable-borrow-with-borrow_val "Direct link to Mutable borrow with borrow_val")

You can use the PTB-friendly kiosk::borrow_val function. It allows you to take an asset and place it back in the same transaction. To make sure the asset is placed back into the kiosk, the function "obliges" the caller with a “Hot Potato”.

### Mutable borrow with `borrow_val` using programmable transaction blocks[​](#mutable-borrow-with-borrow_val-using-programmable-transaction-blocks "Direct link to mutable-borrow-with-borrow_val-using-programmable-transaction-blocks")

```

    
    
    let tx =newTransaction();let itemType ='ITEM_TYPE';let itemId = tx.pure.id('<ITEM_ID>');let kioskArg = tx.object('<ID>');let capArg = tx.object('<ID>');let[item, promise]= tx.moveCall({target:'0x2::kiosk::borrow_val',arguments:[kioskArg, capArg, itemId],typeArguments:[itemType],});// freely mutate or reference the `item`// any calls are available as long as they take a reference// `returnValue` must be explicitly calledtx.moveCall({target:'0x2::kiosk::return_val',arguments:[kioskArg, item, promise],typeArguments:[itemType],});
```

## Withdraw proceeds from a completed sale[​](#withdraw-proceeds-from-a-completed-sale "Direct link to Withdraw proceeds from a completed sale")

When someone purchases an item, Sui stores the proceeds from the sale in the kiosk. As the kiosk owner, you can withdraw the proceeds at any time by calling the `kiosk::withdraw` function. The function is simple, but because it is PTB friendly it is not currently supported in the Sui CLI.

### Withdraw proceeds using programmable transaction blocks[​](#withdraw-proceeds-using-programmable-transaction-blocks "Direct link to Withdraw proceeds using programmable transaction blocks")

```

    
    
    let tx =newTransaction();let kioskArg = tx.object('<ID>');let capArg = tx.object('<ID>');// because the function uses an Option<u64> argument,// constructing is a bit more complexlet amountArg = tx.moveCall({target:'0x1::option::some',arguments:[tx.pure.u64('<amount>')],typeArguments:['u64'],});// alternativelylet withdrawAllArg = tx.moveCall({target:'0x1::option::none',typeArguments:['u64'],});let coin = tx.moveCall({target:'0x2::kiosk::withdraw',arguments:[kioskArg, capArg, amountArg],typeArguments:['u64'],});
```

### Withdraw proceeds using the Sui CLI[​](#withdraw-proceeds-using-the-sui-cli "Direct link to Withdraw proceeds using the Sui CLI")

This action is not currently supported in the CLI environment.

# kiosk-apps
# Kiosk Apps

Kiosk apps are a way to extend the functionality of Sui Kiosk while keeping the core functionality intact. You can develop apps to add new features to a kiosk without having to modify the core code or move the assets elsewhere.

There are two types of apps:

## Basic apps[​](#basic-apps "Direct link to Basic apps")

Basic Kiosk apps do not require Kiosk Apps API to function. They usually serve the purpose of adding custom metadata to a kiosk or wrapping/working with existing objects such as `Kiosk` or `KioskOwnerCap`. An example of an app that does not require the API is the Personal Kiosk app.

### UID access via the uid_mut[​](#uid-access-via-the-uid_mut "Direct link to UID access via the uid_mut")

Kiosk has an `id: UID` field like all objects on Sui, which allows this object to be uniquely identified and carry custom dynamic fields and dynamic object fields. The Kiosk itself is built around dynamic fields and features like place and list are built around dynamic object fields.

### The uid_mut_as_owner function[​](#the-uid_mut_as_owner-function "Direct link to The uid_mut_as_owner function")

Kiosk can carry additional dynamic fields and dynamic object fields. The `uid_mut_as_owner` function allows the Kiosk owner to mutably access the UID of the Kiosk object and use it to add or remove custom fields.

Function signature:

`kiosk::uid_mut_as_owner(self: &mut Kiosk, cap: &KioskOwnerCap): &mut UID`

### The public uid getter[​](#the-public-uid-getter "Direct link to The public uid getter")

Anyone can read the `uid` of kiosks. This allows third party modules to read the fields of the kiosk if they're allowed to do so. Therefore enabling the object capability and other patterns.

### Basic app ideas[​](#basic-app-ideas "Direct link to Basic app ideas")

You can attach custom dynamic fields to your kiosks that anyone can then read (but only you can modify), you can use this to implement basic apps. For example, a Kiosk Name app where you as the kiosk owner can set a name for the kiosk, attach it as a dynamic field, and make it readable by anyone.

```

    
    
    module examples::kiosk_name_ext {usestd::string::String;usestd::option::{Self, Option};usesui::dynamic_fieldasdf;usesui::kiosk::{Self, Kiosk, KioskOwnerCap};/// The dynamic field key for the Kiosk Name Extensionstruct KioskNamehascopy, store, drop {}/// Add a name to the Kiosk (in this implementation can be called only once)publicfunadd(self: &mut Kiosk, cap: &KioskOwnerCap, name: String) {letuid_mut = kiosk::uid_mut_as_owner(self, cap);    df::add(uid_mut, KioskName {}, name)  }/// Try read the name of the Kiosk - if set - return Some(String), if not - Nonepublicfunname(self: &Kiosk): Option<String> {if (df::exists_(kiosk::uid(self), KioskName {})) {      option::some(*df::borrow(kiosk::uid(self), KioskName {}))    } else {      option::none()    }  }}
```

## Permissioned apps using the Kiosk Apps API[​](#permissioned-apps "Direct link to Permissioned apps using the Kiosk Apps API")

Permissioned apps use the Kiosk Apps API to perform actions in the kiosk. They usually imply interaction with a third party and provide guarantees for the storage access (preventing malicious actions from the seller).

Just having access to the `uid` is often not enough to build an app due to the security limitations. Only the owner of a kiosk has full access to the `uid`, which means that an app involving a third party would require involvement from the kiosk owner in every step of the process.

In addition to limited and constrained access to storage, app permissions are also owner dependent. In the default setup, no party can place or lock items in a kiosk without its owner's consent. As a result, some cases such as collection bidding (offering X SUI for any item in a collection) requires the kiosk owner to approve the bid.

## kiosk_extension module[​](#kiosk_extension-module "Direct link to kiosk_extension module")

The `kiosk_extension` module addresses concerns over owner bottlenecks and provides more guarantees for storage access. The module provides a set of functions that enable you to perform certain actions in the kiosk without the kiosk owner's involvement and have a guarantee that the storage of the app is not tampered with.

```

    
    
    module example::my_extension {usesui::kiosk_extension;// ...}
```

## App lifecycle[​](#app-lifecycle "Direct link to App lifecycle")

These are the key points in the lifecycle of a Sui Kiosk app:

  * You can only install an app with an explicit call in the `kiosk_extension` module.
  * A kiosk owner can revoke permissions of an app at any time by calling the `disable` function.
  * A kiosk owner can re-enable a disabled app at any time by calling the `enable` function.
  * You can only remove apps if the app storage is empty (all items are removed).

## Adding an app[​](#adding-an-app "Direct link to Adding an app")

For the app to function, the kiosk owner first needs to install it. To achieve that, an app needs to implement the `add` function that the kiosk owner calls to request all necessary permissions.

### Implementing add function[​](#implementing-add-function "Direct link to Implementing add function")

The signature of the `kiosk_extension::add` function requires the app witness, making it impossible to install an app without an explicit implementation. The following example shows how to implement the `add` function for an app that requires the `place` permission:

```

    
    
    module examples::letterbox_ext {// ... dependencies/// The expected set of permissions for extension. It requires `place`.constPERMISSIONS: u128 = 1;/// The Witness struct used to identify and authorize the extension.struct Extensionhasdrop {}/// Install the Mallbox extension into the Kiosk.publicfunadd(kiosk: &mut Kiosk, cap: &KioskOwnerCap, ctx: &mut TxContext) {    kiosk_extension::add(Extension {}, kiosk, cap, PERMISSIONS, ctx)  }}
```

## App permissions[​](#app-permissions "Direct link to App permissions")

Apps can request permissions from the kiosk owner on installation. Permissions follow the all or nothing principle. If the kiosk owner adds an app, it gets all of the requested permissions; if the kiosk owner then disables an app, it loses all of its permissions.

### Structure[​](#structure "Direct link to Structure")

Permissions are represented as a `u128` integer storing a bitmap. Each of the bits corresponds to a permission, the first bit is the least significant bit. The following table lists all permissions and their corresponding bit:

Bit| Decimal| Permission  
---|---|---  
0000| 0| No permissions  
0001| 1| App can place  
0010| 2| App can place and lock  
0011| 3| App can place and lock  
  
info

Currently, Sui Kiosk has only two permissions: `place` (first bit) and `lock` and `place` (second bit). The remaining bits are reserved for future use.

### Using permissions in the add function[​](#using-permissions-in-the-add-function "Direct link to Using permissions in the add function")

It's considered good practice to define a constant containing permissions of the app:

```

    
    
    module examples::letterbox_ext {// ... dependencies/// The expected set of permissions for the app. It requires `place`.constPERMISSIONS: u128 = 1;/// The witness struct used to identify and authorize the app.struct Extensionhasdrop {}/// Install the Mallbox app into the kiosk and request `place` permission.publicfunadd(kiosk: &mut Kiosk, cap: &KioskOwnerCap, ctx: &mut TxContext) {    kiosk_extension::add(Extension {}, kiosk, cap, PERMISSIONS, ctx)  }}
```

### Accessing protected functions[​](#accessing-protected-functions "Direct link to Accessing protected functions")

If an app requests and is granted permissions (and isn't disabled), it can access protected functions. The following example shows how to access the `place` function:

```

    
    
    module examples::letterbox_ext {// .../// Emitted when trying to place an item without permissions.constENotEnoughPermissions: u64 = 1;/// Place a letter into the kiosk without the `KioskOwnerCap`.publicfunplace(kiosk: &mut Kiosk, letter: Letter, policy: &TransferPolicy<T>) {assert!(kiosk_extension::can_place<Extension>(kiosk), ENotEnoughPermissions)    kiosk_extension::place(Extension {}, kiosk, letter, policy)  }}
```

Currently, two functions are available:

  * `place<Ext, T>(Ext, &mut Kiosk, T, &TransferPolicy<T>)` - similar to place
  * `lock<Ext, T>(Ext, &mut Kiosk, T, &TransferPolicy<T>)` - similar to lock

### Checking permissions[​](#checking-permissions "Direct link to Checking permissions")

Use the `can_place<Ext>(kiosk: &Kiosk): bool` function to check if the app has the `place` permission. Similarly, you can use the `can_lock<Ext>(kiosk: &Kiosk): bool` function to check if the app has the `lock` permission. Both functions make sure that the app is enabled, so you don't need to explicitly check for that.

## App storage[​](#app-storage "Direct link to App storage")

Every app gets its isolated storage as a [bag type](/concepts/dynamic-fields/tables-bags) that only the app module can access (providing the app witness). After you install an app, it can use the storage to store its data. Ideally, the storage should be managed in a way that allows the app to be removed from the kiosk if there are no active trades or other activities happening at the moment.

The storage is always available to the app if it is installed. The owner of a kiosk can't access the storage of the app if the logic for it is not implemented.

### Accessing the storage[​](#accessing-the-storage "Direct link to Accessing the storage")

An installed app can access the storage mutably or immutably using one of the following functions:

  * `storage(_ext: Extension {}, kiosk: &Kiosk): Bag`: returns a reference to the storage of the app. Use the function to read the storage.
  * `storage_mut(_ext: Extension {}, kiosk: &mut Kiosk): &mut Bag`: returns a mutable reference to the storage of the app. Use the function to read and write to the storage.

## Disabling and removing[​](#disabling-and-removing "Direct link to Disabling and removing")

The kiosk owner can disable any app at any time. Doing so revokes all permissions of the app and prevents it from performing any actions in the kiosk. The kiosk owner can also re-enable the app at any time.

Disabling an app does not remove it from the kiosk. An installed app has access to its storage until completely removed from the kiosk.

### Disabling an app[​](#disabling-an-app "Direct link to Disabling an app")

Use the `disable<Ext>(kiosk: &mut Kiosk, cap: &KioskOwnerCap)` function to disable an app. It revokes all permissions of the app and prevents it from performing any protected actions in the kiosk.

**Example PTB**

```

    
    
    lettxb = new TransactionBuilder();letkioskArg = tx.object('<ID>');letcapArg = tx.object('<ID>');txb.moveCall({target: '0x2::kiosk_extension::disable',arguments: [ kioskArg, capArg ],typeArguments: '<letter_box_package>::letterbox_ext::Extension'});
```

### Removing an app[​](#removing-an-app "Direct link to Removing an app")

You can remove an app only if the storage is empty. Use the `remove<Ext>(kiosk: &mut Kiosk, cap: &KioskOwnerCap)` function to facilitate removal. The function removes the app, unpacks the app storage and configuration and rebates the storage cost to the kiosk owner. Only the kiosk owner can perform this action.

The call fails if the storage is not empty.

**Example PTB**

```

    
    
    lettxb = new TransactionBuilder();letkioskArg = tx.object('<ID>');letcapArg = tx.object('<ID>');txb.moveCall({target: '0x2::kiosk_extension::remove',arguments: [ kioskArg, capArg ],typeArguments: '<letter_box_package>::letterbox_ext::Extension'});
```

# display
# Sui Object Display

The Sui Object Display standard is a template engine that enables on-chain management of off-chain representation (display) for a type. With it, you can substitute data for an object into a template string. The standard doesn’t limit the fields you can set. You can use the `{property}` syntax to access all object properties, and then insert them as a part of the template string.

Use a `Publisher` object that you own to set `sui::display` for a type. For more information about `Publisher` objects, see [Publisher](https://examples.sui.io/basics/publisher.html) topic in _Sui Move by Example_.

In Sui Move, `Display<T>` represents an object that specifies a set of named templates for the type `T`. For example, for a type `0x2::capy::Capy` the display syntax is: `Display<0x2::capy::Capy>`.

Sui Full nodes process all objects of the type `T` by matching the `Display` definition, and return the processed result when you query an object with the `{ showDisplay: true }` setting in the query.

## Display properties[​](#display-properties "Direct link to Display properties")

The basic set of properties suggested includes:

  * `name` - A name for the object. The name is displayed when users view the object.
  * `description` - A description for the object. The description is displayed when users view the object.
  * `link` - A link to the object to use in an application.
  * `image_url` - A URL or a blob with the image for the object.
  * `thumbnail_url` - A URL to a **smaller** image to use in wallets, explorers, and other products as a preview.
  * `project_url` - A link to a website associated with the object or creator.
  * `creator` - A string that indicates the object creator.

### An example Sui Hero module[​](#an-example-sui-hero-module "Direct link to An example Sui Hero module")

The following code sample demonstrates how the `Display` for an example `Hero` module varies based on the `name`, `id`, and `image_url` properties of the type `Hero`. The following represents the template the `init` function defines:

```

    
    
    {"name":"{name}","link":"https://sui-heroes.io/hero/{id}","image_url":"ipfs://{image_url}","description":"A true Hero of the Sui ecosystem!","project_url":"https://sui-heroes.io","creator":"Unknown Sui Fan"}
```

```

    
    
    /// Example of an unlimited "Sui Hero" collection - anyone can/// mint their Hero. Shows how to initialize the `Publisher` and how/// to use it to get the `Display<Hero>` object - a way to describe a/// type for the ecosystem.module examples::my_hero {usesui::tx_context::{sender};usestd::string::{utf8, String};// The creator bundle: these two packages often go together.usesui::package;usesui::display;/// The Hero - an outstanding collection of digital art.publicstruct Herohaskey, store {id: UID,name: String,image_url: String,  }/// One-Time-Witness for the module.publicstruct MY_HEROhasdrop {}/// In the module initializer one claims the `Publisher` object/// to then create a `Display`. The `Display` is initialized with/// a set of fields (but can be modified later) and published via/// the `update_version` call.////// Keys and values are set in the initializer but could also be/// set after publishing if a `Publisher` object was created.funinit(otw: MY_HERO, ctx: &mut TxContext) {letkeys = vector[      utf8(b"name"),      utf8(b"link"),      utf8(b"image_url"),      utf8(b"description"),      utf8(b"project_url"),      utf8(b"creator"),    ];letvalues = vector[// For `name` one can use the `Hero.name` property      utf8(b"{name}"),// For `link` one can build a URL using an `id` property      utf8(b"https://sui-heroes.io/hero/{id}"),// For `image_url` use an IPFS template + `image_url` property.      utf8(b"ipfs://{image_url}"),// Description is static for all `Hero` objects.      utf8(b"A true Hero of the Sui ecosystem!"),// Project URL is usually static      utf8(b"https://sui-heroes.io"),// Creator field can be any      utf8(b"Unknown Sui Fan")    ];// Claim the `Publisher` for the package!letpublisher = package::claim(otw, ctx);// Get a new `Display` object for the `Hero` type.letmutdisplay = display::new_with_fields<Hero>(      &publisher, keys, values, ctx    );// Commit first version of `Display` to apply changes.    display::update_version(&mut display);    transfer::public_transfer(publisher, sender(ctx));    transfer::public_transfer(display, sender(ctx));  }/// Anyone can mint their `Hero`!publicfunmint(name: String, image_url: String, ctx: &mut TxContext): Hero {letid = object::new(ctx);    Hero { id, name, image_url }  }}
```

## Work with Object Display[​](#work-with-object-display "Direct link to Work with Object Display")

The `display::new<T>` call creates a `Display`, either in a custom function or module initializer, or as part of a programmable transaction. The following code sample demonstrates how to create a `Display`:

```

    
    
    module sui::display {/// Get a new Display object for the `T`./// Publisher must be the publisher of the T, `from_package`/// check is performed.publicfunnew<T>(pub: &Publisher): Display<T> { /* ... */ }}
```

After you create the `Display`, you can modify it. The following code sample demonstrates how to modify a `Display`:

```

    
    
    module sui::display {/// Sets multiple fields at oncepublicfunadd_multiple(self: &mut Display,keys: vector<String>,values: vector<String>  ) { /* ... */ }/// Edit a single fieldpublicfunedit(self: &mut Display, key: String, value: String) { /* ... */ }/// Remove a key from Displaypublicfunremove(self: &mut Display, key: String ) { /* ... */ }}
```

Next, the `update_version` call applies the changes and sets the `Display` for the `T` by emitting an event. Full nodes receive the event and use the data in the event to retrieve a template for the type.

The following code sample demonstrates how to use the `update_version` call:

```

    
    
    module sui::display {/// Update the version of Display and emit an eventpublicfunupdate_version(self: &mut Display) { /* ... */ }}
```

## Sui utility objects[​](#sui-utility-objects "Direct link to Sui utility objects")

In Sui, utility objects enable authorization for capabilities. Almost all modules have features that can be accessed only with the required capability. Generic modules allow one capability per application, such as a marketplace. Some capabilities mark ownership of a shared object on-chain, or access the shared data from another account. With capabilities, it is important to provide a meaningful description of objects to facilitate user interface implementation. This helps avoid accidentally transferring the wrong object when objects are similar. It also provides a user-friendly description of items that users see.

The following example demonstrates how to create a capy capability:

```

    
    
    module capy::utility {/// A capability which grants Capy Manager permission to add/// new genes and manage the Capy Marketstruct CapyManagerCaphaskey, store {id: UID }}
```

## Typical objects with data duplication[​](#typical-objects-with-data-duplication "Direct link to Typical objects with data duplication")

A common case with in-game items is to have a large number of similar objects grouped by some criteria. It is important to optimize their size and the cost to mint and update them. Typically, a game uses a single source image or URL per group or item criteria. Storing the source image inside of every object is not optimal. In some cases, users mint in-game items when a game allows them or when they purchase an in-game item. To enable this, some IPFS/Arweave metadata must be created and stored in advance. This requires additional logic that is usually not related to the in-game properties of the item.

The following example demonstrates how to create a Capy:

```

    
    
    module capy::capy_items {/// A wearable Capy item. For some items there can be an/// unlimited supply. And items with the same name are identical.struct CapyItemhaskey, store {id: UID,name: String  }}
```

## Unique objects with dynamic representation[​](#unique-objects-with-dynamic-representation "Direct link to Unique objects with dynamic representation")

Sui Capys use dynamic image generation. When a Capy is born, its attributes determine the Capy’s appearance, such as color or pattern. When a user puts an item on a Capy, the Capy’s appearance changes. When users put multiple items on a Capy, there’s a chance of a bonus for a combination of items.

To implement this, the Capys game API service refreshes the image in response to a user-initiated change. The URL for a Capy is a template with the `capy.id`. But storing the full URL - as well as other fields in the Capy object due to their diverse population - also leads to users paying for excess storage and increased gas fees.

The following example demonstrates how to implement dynamic image generation:

```

    
    
    module capy::capy {/// A Capy - very diverse object with different combination/// of genes. Created dynamically + for images a dynamic SVG/// generation is used.struct Capyhaskey, store {id: UID,genes: vector<u8>  }}
```

## Objects with unique static content[​](#objects-with-unique-static-content "Direct link to Objects with unique static content")

This is the simplest scenario - an object represents everything itself. It is very easy to apply a metadata standard to an object of this kind, especially if the object stays immutable forever. However, if the metadata standard evolves and some ecosystem projects add new features for some properties, this object always stays in its original form and might require backward-compatible changes.

```

    
    
    module sui::devnet_nft {/// A Collectible with a static data. URL, name, description are/// set only once on a mint eventstruct DevNetNFThaskey, store {id: UID,name: String,description: String,url: Url,  }}
```

# wallet-standard
# Wallet Standard

Browser extension wallets built for Sui use the [Wallet standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard/). This is a cross-chain standard that defines how dApps can automatically discover and interact with wallets.

If you are building a wallet, the helper library `@mysten/wallet-standard` provides types and utilities to help get started.

## Working with wallets[​](#working-with-wallets "Direct link to Working with wallets")

The Wallet standard includes features to help build wallets.

### Creating a wallet interface[​](#creating-a-wallet-interface "Direct link to Creating a wallet interface")

Create a class that represents your wallet. Use the `Wallet` interface from `@mysten/wallet-standard` to help ensure your class adheres to the standard.

```

    
    
    import{SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN,Wallet}from'@mysten/wallet-standard';classYourWalletimplementsWallet{getversion(){// Return the version of the Wallet Standard this implements (in this case, 1.0.0).return'1.0.0';}getname(){return'Wallet Name';}geticon(){return'some-icon-data-url';}// Return the Sui chains that your wallet supports.getchains(){return[SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN];}}
```

### Implementing features[​](#implementing-features "Direct link to Implementing features")

Features are standard methods consumers can use to interact with a wallet. To be listed in the Sui wallet adapter, you must implement the following features in your wallet:

  * `standard:connect` - Use to initiate a connection to the wallet.
  * `standard:events` - Use to listen for changes that happen within the wallet, such as accounts being added or removed.
  * `sui:signPersonalMessage` - Use to prompt the user to sign a personal message and return the message signature back to the dApp. Use this to verify the user’s public key.
  * `sui:signTransaction` - Use to prompt the user to sign a transaction and return the serialized transaction and signature back to the dApp. This method does not submit the transaction for execution.
  * `sui:signAndExecuteTransaction` - Use to prompt the user to sign a transaction, then submit it for execution to the blockchain.
  * `sui:reportTransactionEffects` - Use to report the effects of a transaction executed in the dApp to the wallet. This allows the wallet to update its internal state to reflect the changes the transaction makes.
  * `sui:signTransactionBlock` - The previous version of `sui:signTransaction`. Still implemented for compatibility with dApps that have not updated to the new feature.
  * `sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` - The previous version of `sui:signAndExecuteTransaction`. Still implemented for compatibility with dApps that have not updated to the new feature.

Implement these features in your wallet class under the `features` property:

```

    
    
    import{ConnectFeature,ConnectMethod,EventsFeature,EventsOnMethod,SuiFeatures,SuiSignPersonalMessageMethod,SuiSignTransactionMethod,SuiSignAndExecuteTransactionMethod,SuiReportTransactionEffectsMethod}from"@mysten/wallet-standard";classYourWalletimplementsWallet{/* ... existing code from above ... */getfeatures():ConnectFeature&EventsFeature&SuiFeatures{return{"standard:connect":{    version:"1.0.0",    connect:this.#connect,},"standard:events":{    version:"1.0.0",    on:this.#on,},"sui:signPersonalMessage":{    version:"1.0.0",				signPersonalMessage:this.#signPersonalMessage,},"sui:signTransaction":{    version:"2.0.0",    signTransaction:this.#signTransaction,},"sui:signAndExecuteTransaction":{    version:"2.0.0",    signAndExecuteTransaction:this.#signAndExecuteTransactionBlock,},"sui:reportTransactionEffects":{    version:"1.0.0",    reportTransactionEffects:this.#reportTransactionEffects,};}, #on:EventsOnMethod=()=>{// Your wallet's events on implementation.}; #connect:ConnectMethod=()=>{// Your wallet's connect implementation};	#signPersonalMessage:SuiSignPersonalMessageMethod=()=>{// Your wallet's signTransaction implementation}; #signTransaction:SuiSignTransactionMethod=()=>{// Your wallet's signTransaction implementation}; #signAndExecuteTransaction:SuiSignAndExecuteTransactionMethod=()=>{// Your wallet's signAndExecuteTransaction implementation}; #reportTransactionEffects:SuiReportTransactionEffectsMethod=()=>{// Your wallet's reportTransactionEffects implementation};}
```

### Exposing accounts[​](#exposing-accounts "Direct link to Exposing accounts")

The last requirement of the wallet interface is to expose an `accounts` interface. This should expose all of the accounts that a connected dApp has access to. It can be empty prior to initiating a connection through the `standard:connect` feature.

The accounts use the `ReadonlyWalletAccount` class to construct an account matching the required interface.

```

    
    
    import{ReadonlyWalletAccount}from'@mysten/wallet-standard';classYourWalletimplementsWallet{getaccounts(){// Assuming we already have some internal representation of accounts:return someWalletAccounts.map((walletAccount)=>// ReturnnewReadonlyWalletAccount({					address: walletAccount.suiAddress,					publicKey: walletAccount.pubkey,// The Sui chains that your wallet supports.					chains:[SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN],// The features that this account supports. This can be a subset of the wallet's supported features.// These features must exist on the wallet as well.					features:['sui:signPersonalMessage','sui:signTransactionBlock','sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock',],}),);}}
```

### Registering in the window[​](#registering-in-the-window "Direct link to Registering in the window")

After you have a compatible interface for your wallet, use the `registerWallet` function to register it.

```

    
    
    import{ registerWallet }from'@mysten/wallet-standard';registerWallet(newYourWallet());
```

### Best practices for efficient transaction execution[​](#best-practices-for-efficient-transaction-execution "Direct link to Best practices for efficient transaction execution")

The Wallet standard has been updated from its original design to better support changes in the Sui ecosystem. For example, the GraphQL service was introduced after Mainnet launched. The `sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` feature is closely tied to the JSON RPC options and data structures, so its continued maintenance becomes increasingly difficult as the GraphQL service becomes more ubiquitous.

Consequently, the Wallet standard introduced the `sui:signAndExecuteTransaction` feature. The features of this method are more useful, regardless of which API you use to execute transactions. This usefulness comes at the expense of flexibility in what `sui:signAndExecuteTransaction` returns.

To solve this problem, use the `sui:signTransaction` feature to sign transactions, and leave transaction execution to the dApp. The dApp can query for additional data during execution using whichever API it chooses. This is consistent with the default `@mysten/dapp-kit` uses for the `useSignAndExecuteTransaction` hook, and enables dApps to take advantage of read-after-write consistency when interacting with the Full-node based JSON RPC.

The downside of this strategy is that wallets often use different RPC nodes than the dApp, and might not have indexed the previous transaction when executing multiple transactions in rapid succession. This leads to building transactions using stale data that fail upon execution.

To mitigate this, wallets can use the `sui:reportTransactionEffects` feature so that dApps can report the effects of transactions to the wallet. Transaction effects contain the updated versions and digests of any objects that a transaction uses or creates. By caching these values, wallets can build transactions without needing to resolve the most recent versions through an API call.

The `@mysten/sui/transaction` SDK exports the `SerialTransactionExecutor` class, which you can use to build transactions using an object cache. The class has a method to update its internal cache using the effects of a transaction.

Using the combination of `sui:signTransaction` and `sui:reportTransactionEffects`, dApps can use either API to execute transactions and query for any data the API exposes. The dApp can then report the effects of the transaction to the wallet, and the wallet can then execute transactions without running into issues caused by a lagging indexer.

## Managing wallets[​](#managing-wallets "Direct link to Managing wallets")

The Wallet standard includes features to help your apps interact with wallets.

### Wallet data[​](#wallet-data "Direct link to Wallet data")

To query the installed wallets in a user's browser, use the `get` function of `getWallets`.

```

    
    
    import{ getWallets }from'@mysten/wallet-standard';const availableWallets =getWallets().get();
```

The return from this call (`availableWallets` in the previous code) is an array of `Wallet` types.

Use the `Wallet.icon` and `Wallet.name` attributes to display the wallet details on your web page.

The `Wallet.accounts` is an array of `WalletAccount`s. Each `WalletAccount` type has `address` and `publicKey` properties, which are most useful during development. This data fills and caches after connection.

### Features[​](#features "Direct link to Features")

Both the `Wallet` type and the `WalletAccount` type have a property called `features`. The main wallet functionality is found here. The mandatory features that wallets must implement are listed in the previous code.

Many wallets choose to omit some non-mandatory features or add some custom features, so be sure to check the relevant wallet documentation if you intend to integrate a specific wallet.

### Connecting a wallet[​](#connecting-a-wallet "Direct link to Connecting a wallet")

Connecting in the context of a wallet refers to a user that joins the web site for the first time and has to choose the wallet and addresses to use.

The feature that provides this functionality is called `standard:connect`. To connect using this feature, make the following call:

```

    
    
    wallet.features['standard:connect'].connect();// connect call
```

This call results in the wallet opening a pop-up dialog for the user to continue the connection process.

### Disconnecting a wallet[​](#disconnecting-a-wallet "Direct link to Disconnecting a wallet")

Similar to the connecting feature, the Wallet standard also includes `standard:disconnect`. The following example calls this feature:

```

    
    
    wallet.features['standard:disconnect'].disconnect();
```

### Transactions - suggested approach[​](#transactions---suggested-approach "Direct link to Transactions - suggested approach")

Upon wallet connection, your app has the necessary information to execute transactions, such as address and method.

Construct the transaction separately with the `@mysten/sui` library and then sign it with the private key of the user. Use the `sui:signTransaction` feature to achieve this:

```

    
    
    wallet.features[sui:signTransaction].singTransaction(<Transaction>, <WalletAccount>);
```

Similar to connections, this process opens a pop-up dialog for the user to either accept or decline the transaction. Upon accepting, the function returns an object in the form `{bytes: String, signature: Uint8Array}`. The `bytes` value is the `b64` encoding of the transaction and the `signature` value is the transaction signature.

To execute the transaction, use `SuiClient` from `@mysten/sui`:

```

    
    
    const client:SuiClientclient.executeTransactionBlock({  transactionBlock: bytes,  signature: signature,  options:{}})
```

Your app then sends the transaction effects back to the wallet, which reports results to the user. The wallet expects the effects to be `b64` encoded.

```

    
    
    import{ toBase64 }from'@mysten/sui/utils';wallet.features['sui:reportTransactionEffects'].reportTransactionEffects(  effects:Array.isArray(transactionResponse.effects)?toBase64(Uint8Array.from(transactionResponse.effects): transactionResponse.effects,    account: wallet.accounts[0],// for example    chain: wallet.chains[0])
```

### Transactions - abbreviated approach[​](#transactions---abbreviated-approach "Direct link to Transactions - abbreviated approach")

Many wallets abstract the above flow into one feature: `sui:signAndExecuteTransaction`. The required arguments for this feature are the raw transaction and the options with the desired information to be included in the response:

  * `showEffects`: Include the transaction effects.
  * `showEvents`: Include the transaction events.
  * `showObjectChanges`: Include all the objects that were deleted, created, or mutated.
  * `showBalanceChanges`: Include any coin transfer that took place.
  * `showInput`: Include the transaction's input.
  * `showRawInput`: Same as `showInput` but the format is raw.

### Events wallets emit[​](#events-wallets-emit "Direct link to Events wallets emit")

The wallet emits events on certain user actions that apps can listen to. These events allow your app to be responsive to user actions on their wallets.

The wallet standard only defines the change event that can apply to chains, features, or accounts.

  * `chains`: A change event on the chains means the user switched the wallet's active network, such as from Devnet to Testnet.
  * `features`: The user added or removed permission for your app to access certain wallet features.
  * `accounts`: The user added or removed an account (address) to interact with your app.

To subscribe your apps to events with the following call:

```

    
    
    const unsubscribe = wallet.features['standard:events'].on('change', callback);
```

This call returns a function that can be called to unsubscribe from listening to the events.

The callback is the handler that contains the logic to perform when the event fires. The input to the callback function is an object with the following type:

```

    
    
    {  accounts:WalletAccount[],  chains:IdentifierArray,  features:IdentifierRecord<unknown>}
```

These values are all arrays containing the new or changed items. Consequently, every event populates only one array in most cases, the rest are empty.

### Implementation example[​](#implementation-example "Direct link to Implementation example")

Mysten Labs offers a bare bones scaffold for React-based applications called `@mysten/dapp-kit`. See the [dApp Kit documentation](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit) for more informqtion.

# components
# Sui Components

The name Sui, pronounced swē in English, is derived from a Japanese word for the element of water. You can see this influence in the name of the blockchain, its native token elements (SUI and MIST), and the imagery used in its branding.

When you read about Sui in this documentation, it's referencing all the pieces of the system that comprise the blockchain. This includes the blockchain itself, its various networks (Mainnet, for example), the activity on the blockchain (transaction blocks), the distributed entities that verify this activity (validators), and the Full nodes that execute transaction blocks. The documentation refers to the entirety of these elements as the Sui platform, or simply Sui.

## The Sui blockchain[​](#the-sui-blockchain "Direct link to The Sui blockchain")

Sui is defined as a Layer 1 protocol blockchain. In basic terms, this means that Sui performs its own consensus and validation for transaction blocks (activity) on its networks using its own native token (SUI, in this case). Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) are other examples of Layer 1 blockchains.

Layer 2 blockchains, by contrast, leverage the infrastructure of Layer 1 networks, relying on the Layer 1 blockchain to finalize transaction blocks. Polygon (MATIC) is an example of a Layer 2 blockchain that extends Ethereum.

## SUI tokens[​](#sui-tokens "Direct link to SUI tokens")

The native token for Sui is SUI. Whenever the documentation mentions SUI (all uppercase letters), it's referring to this token. Transaction blocks on Sui often deal with small fractions of the value of one SUI. To make these transaction blocks easier to work with, Sui provides MIST. It takes one billion MIST to equal one SUI.

There is a cost associated with everything, and blockchain transactions are no exception. It costs money to provide computational power to process transaction blocks and store their results. The term for the cost of processing transaction blocks is "gas". You pay for gas and the cost of storing data with a blockchain's native tokens, in this case, SUI (or MIST).

To learn more about the tokenomics of Sui, see the following topics:

## Delegated proof-of-stake consensus[​](#delegated-proof-of-stake-consensus "Direct link to Delegated proof-of-stake consensus")

Sui uses a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism to validate on-chain transaction blocks. This means that validators on the Sui network must have a certain amount of SUI secured on Sui Mainnet, either with their own funds or in partnership with Sui Foundation, to prove their interest in the security of the blockchain. This approach aligns the interest of all validators with that of Sui users (an efficient, secure blockchain), without the high energy-resource demands of earlier blockchains.

To learn more about consensus on Sui, see the following guides and topics:

## Sui networks[​](#sui-networks "Direct link to Sui networks")

Sui has several networks available, each serving a different purpose.

  * **Mainnet:** The network that processes production transaction blocks. When you trade SUI or NFTs that are ultimately based on fiat currency, you are doing so on the Mainnet network of Sui.
  * **Testnet:** Staging network to provide quality assurance that any planned changes to Sui do not adversely impact performance. Developers can use this network to test their code before placing it in production.
  * **Devnet:** A more unstable network that is used to develop new features. Developers can leverage this network to code against the latest planned features of Sui.
  * **Localnet:** You can run a Sui network on your local computer. Developing on a local network provides an optimized workflow in an environment you control.

To learn more about these networks and how to interact with them, see the following guides:

## Move[​](#move "Direct link to Move")

The Move language provides the logic for all activity on Sui, like trading NFTs, playing Sui-integrated games (dApps), and all other transaction-based events. The Sui platform uses a concept novel to earlier blockchains, where blocks on the chain are actually objects that define assets rather than simple key-value stores that define addresses. The increased programmability inherent with objects required a more robust logic engine to maximize the benefits of this new approach to blockchain technology.

To learn more about Move, see [Move Concepts](/concepts/sui-move-concepts).

# cryptography
# Cryptography

Cryptographic agility is core to Sui. The system supports multiple cryptography algorithms and primitives and can switch between them rapidly. With Sui, you can choose the right cryptography solution for your system and implement the latest algorithms as they become available.

Sui defines its cryptography primitives, such as public key, signature, aggregated signature, and hash functions, under one unified type alias or enum wrapper that is shared across the entire repository. Making changes to these primitives affects all of an application's components. You can quickly update application cryptography and be assured of uniform security.

# sui-architecture
# Sui Architecture

Sui shares some similarities with other blockchains but is unique in many ways. Use the topics in this section to understand the features that define the Sui network.

## Understand Sui Security[​](#understand-sui-security "Direct link to Understand Sui Security")

Learn about the mechanisms available to secure on-chain assets, and the assurances Sui provides regarding asset security. Understand Sui Security explores the overall Sui security architecture to ensure the asset types you design leverage Sui to provide a secure experience for asset holders.

Go to [Understand Sui Security](/concepts/sui-architecture/sui-security).

## Life of a Transaction[​](#life-of-a-transaction "Direct link to Life of a Transaction")

Life of a Transaction details the transitions that all transactions on Sui go through from creation to finality. This topic also explores some features of the blockchain (like epochs and checkpoints) that play a role in the life of a transaction.

Go to [Life of a Transaction](/concepts/sui-architecture/transaction-lifecycle).

## Consensus[​](#consensus "Direct link to Consensus")

Every transaction on Sui is sequenced by consensus, where validators agree to the same order of execution of the transactions, even if a minority of them are down or are malicious actors that want to harm the network and users. Sui currently uses the [Mysticeti](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14821) consensus algorithm.

Go to [Consensus](/concepts/sui-architecture/consensus).

## Sui Indexer[​](#sui-indexer "Direct link to Sui Indexer")

Running a Sui indexer offloads data processing from your Full node and stores it in a relational database. This topic explores some of the benefits running an indexer has and points to instruction on how to run your own.

Go to [Sui Indexer](/concepts/sui-architecture/indexer-functions).

## Protocol Upgrades[​](#protocol-upgrades "Direct link to Protocol Upgrades")

The Sui protocol, framework, and execution engine are frequently extended to include new functionality and bug fixes. This functionality is added in the form of new code which is released to validator operators as part of our regular software releases. The Sui protocol, however, requires that all Sui validators agree about the results of executing each transaction.

# tokenomics
# Sui Tokenomics

The collective ideation that the term tokenomics encompasses includes a wide range of concepts that define the science and behavior of blockchain economies. In basic terms, tokenomics are the financial foundation of blockchains. Much the same way a building with a poor foundation is doomed to fail, a blockchain without a well-researched, extensively planned, and painstakingly implemented token economy eventually crumbles.

Sui tokenomics are based on sound financial concepts informed by extensive blockchain research. Designed for scale, the Sui tokenomics structure is designed to support the financial needs of web3 now and into the future.

## The Sui economy[​](#the-sui-economy "Direct link to The Sui economy")

Three main types of participants characterize the Sui economy:

  * **Users** submit transactions to the Sui platform to create, mutate, and transfer digital assets or interact with more sophisticated applications enabled by smart contracts, interoperability, and composability.
  * **SUI token holders** have the option of staking their tokens to validators and participating in the proof-of-stake mechanism. SUI owners also hold the rights to participate in Sui governance.
  * **Validators** manage transaction processing and execution on the Sui platform.

## Core components[​](#core-components "Direct link to Core components")

The Sui economy is composed of five core components:

  * **[SUI](/concepts/tokenomics/sui-coin):** The SUI token is the Sui platform native asset.
  * **[Gas fees](/concepts/tokenomics/gas-in-sui):** Gas fees are charged on all network operations and used to reward participants of the proof-of-stake mechanism and prevent spam and denial-of-service attacks.
  * **[Storage fund](/concepts/tokenomics/storage-fund):** The Sui storage fund is used to shift stake rewards across time and compensate future validators for storage costs of previously stored on-chain data.
  * **[Proof-of-stake](/concepts/tokenomics/proof-of-stake):** The delegated proof-of-stake mechanism is used to select, incentivize, and reward honest behavior by Sui Validators and the SUI owners that stake with them.
  * **Voting:** On-chain voting is used for governance and protocol upgrades.

## Tokenomics visualized[​](#tokenomics-visualized "Direct link to Tokenomics visualized")

The following flowchart presents the tokenomic flow of Sui at a high level. Referring back to this chart after you learn concepts in this section should provide additional clarity.

# research-papers
# Sui-Related Research Papers

This document contains a list of research papers that are relevant to Sui and have been co-authored by at least one member of the team. Some of the ideas of these papers are currently being integrated into Sui, others are in our roadmap, and others are not in our roadmap but could be integrated in the future. Start with the [Sui Smart Contract Platform](/assets/files/sui-6251a5c5b9d2fab6b1df0e24ba7c6322.pdf) white paper, which contains our latest design inspired by previous works below.

Latest

## Mysticeti: Reaching the Limits of Latency with Uncertified DAGs[​](#mysticeti "Direct link to Mysticeti: Reaching the Limits of Latency with Uncertified DAGs")

  * **Link:** <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14821>
  * **Publication:** Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), 2025
  * **Relevance:** We introduce Mysticeti-C, the first DAG-based Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve the lower bounds of latency of 3 message rounds. Since Mysticeti-C is built over DAGs it also achieves high resource efficiency and censorship resistance. Mysticeti-C achieves this latency improvement by avoiding explicit certification of the DAG blocks and by proposing a novel commit rule such that every block can be committed without delays, resulting in optimal latency in the steady state and under crash failures. We further extend Mysticeti-C to Mysticeti-FPC, which incorporates a fast commit path that achieves even lower latency for transferring assets. Unlike prior fast commit path protocols, Mysticeti-FPC minimizes the number of signatures and messages by weaving the fast path transactions into the DAG. This frees up resources, which subsequently result in better performance. We prove the safety and liveness in a Byzantine context. We evaluate both Mysticeti protocols and compare them with state-of-the-art consensus and fast path protocols to demonstrate their low latency and resource efficiency, as well as their more graceful degradation under crash failures. Mysticeti-C is the first Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve WAN latency of 0.5s for consensus commit while simultaneously maintaining state-of-the-art throughput of over 200k TPS. Finally, we report on integrating Mysticeti-C as the consensus protocol into the Sui blockchain, resulting in over 4x latency reduction.

## Sui Lutris: A Blockchain Combining Broadcast and Consensus[​](#sui-lutris-a-blockchain-combining-broadcast-and-consensus "Direct link to Sui Lutris: A Blockchain Combining Broadcast and Consensus")

  * **Link:** <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18042>
  * **Publication:** Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), 2024
  * **Relevance:** Sui Lutris is the first smart-contract platform to sustainably achieve sub-second finality. It achieves this significant decrease by employing consensusless agreement not only for simple payments but for a large variety of transactions. Unlike prior work, Sui Lutris neither compromises expressiveness nor throughput and can run perpetually without restarts. Sui Lutris achieves this by safely integrating consensuless agreement with a high-throughput consensus protocol that is invoked out of the critical finality path but ensures that when a transaction is at risk of inconsistent concurrent accesses, its settlement is delayed until the total ordering is resolved. Building such a hybrid architecture is especially delicate during reconfiguration events, where the system needs to preserve the safety of the consensusless path without compromising the long-term liveness of potentially misconfigured clients. We thus develop a novel reconfiguration protocol, the first to provably show the safe and efficient reconfiguration of a consensusless blockchain. Sui Lutris is currently running in production and underpins the Sui smart-contract platform. Combined with the use of Objects instead of accounts it enables the safe execution of smart contracts that expose objects as a first-class resource. In our experiments Sui Lutris achieves latency lower than 0.5 seconds for throughput up to 5,000 certificates per second (150k ops/s with transaction blocks), compared to the state-of-the-art real-world consensus latencies of 3 seconds. Furthermore, it gracefully handles validators crash-recovery and does not suffer visible performance degradation during reconfiguration.

## zkLogin: Privacy-Preserving Blockchain Authentication with Existing Credentials[​](#zklogin-privacy-preserving-blockchain-authentication-with-existing-credentials "Direct link to zkLogin: Privacy-Preserving Blockchain Authentication with Existing Credentials")

  * **Link:** <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11735>
  * **Publication:** Not published
  * **Relevance:** For many users, a private key based wallet serves as the primary entry point to blockchains. Commonly recommended wallet authentication methods, such as mnemonics or hardware wallets, can be cumbersome. This difficulty in user onboarding has significantly hindered the adoption of blockchain-based applications. We develop zkLogin, a novel technique that leverages identity tokens issued by popular platforms (any OpenID Connect enabled platform e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.) to authenticate transactions. At the heart of zkLogin lies a signature scheme allowing the signer to sign using their existing OpenID accounts and nothing else. This improves the user experience significantly as users do not need to remember a new secret and can reuse their existing accounts. zkLogin provides strong security and privacy guarantees. By design, zkLogin builds on top of the underlying platform's authentication mechanisms, and derives its security from there. Unlike prior related works however, zkLogin avoids the use of additional trusted parties (e.g., trusted hardware or oracles) for its security guarantees. zkLogin leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to ensure that the link between a user's off-chain and on-chain identities is hidden, even from the platform itself. We have implemented and deployed zkLogin on the Sui blockchain as an alternative to traditional digital signature-based addresses. Due to the ease of web3 on-boarding just with social login, without requiring mnemonics, many hundreds of thousands zkLogin accounts have already been generated in various industries such as gaming, DeFi, direct payments, NFT collections, ride sharing, sports racing and many more.

## Be Aware of Your Leaders[​](#awareness "Direct link to Be Aware of Your Leaders")

  * **Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00960>
  * **Publication:** Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC), 2022
  * **Relevance:** Provides a performant leader election algorithm for partially-synchronous consensus protocol (such as Bullshark). Sui may want to use it alongside Bullshark to support shared objects.
  * **Summary:** Advances in blockchains have influenced the State-Machine-Replication (SMR) world and many state-of-the-art blockchain-SMR solutions are based on two pillars: Chaining and Leader-rotation. A predetermined round-robin mechanism used for Leader-rotation, however, has an undesirable behavior: crashed parties become designated leaders infinitely often, slowing down overall system performance. In this paper, we provide a new Leader-Aware SMR framework that, among other desirable properties, formalizes a Leader-utilization requirement that bounds the number of rounds whose leaders are faulty in crash-only executions. We introduce Carousel, a novel, reputation-based Leader-rotation solution to achieve Leader-Aware SMR. The challenge in adaptive Leader-rotation is that it cannot rely on consensus to determine a leader, since consensus itself needs a leader. Carousel uses the available on-chain information to determine a leader locally and achieves Liveness despite this difficulty. A HotStuff implementation fitted with Carousel demonstrates drastic performance improvements: it increases throughput over 2x in faultless settings and provides a 20x throughput increase and 5x latency reduction in the presence of faults.

## Bullshark: DAG BFT Protocols Made Practical[​](#bullshark "Direct link to Bullshark: DAG BFT Protocols Made Practical")

  * **Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05677>
  * **Publication:** Not published yet (under submission)
  * **Relevance:** Provides a partially-synchronous consensus protocol running over Narwhal. Sui may want to use it instead of Tusk.
  * **Summary:** We present Bullshark, the first directed acyclic graph (DAG) based Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol that is optimized for partial synchrony. Bullshark inherits all the desired properties of its predecessor (DAG-Rider) such as optimal amortized complexity, asynchronous liveness, zero-overhead, and post-quantum safety; but at the same time Bullshark provides a practical low-latency fast-path that exploits synchronous periods. In addition, we introduce a standalone partially synchronous version of Bullshark and evaluate it against the state of the art. The resulting protocol is embarrassingly simple 20 LOC on top of a DAG-based mempool implementation) and highly efficient, achieving for example, 125k transactions per second and 2 seconds latency with 50 nodes.

## FastPay: High-Performance Byzantine Fault Tolerant Settlement[​](#fastpay "Direct link to FastPay: High-Performance Byzantine Fault Tolerant Settlement")

  * **Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11506>
  * **Publication:** ACM Conference on Advances in Financial Technologies (AFT), 2020
  * **Relevance:** FastPay describes the core protocol at the heart of Sui.
  * **Summary:** FastPay allows a set of distributed validators, some of which are Byzantine, to maintain a high-integrity and availability settlement system for pre-funded payments. It can be used to settle payments in a native unit of value (crypto-currency), or as a financial side-infrastructure to support retail payments in fiat currencies. This is not the protocol Sui uses, yet it proposes the basic safety mechanism that Sui extends. FastPay is based on Byzantine Consistent Broadcast as its core primitive, foregoing the expenses of full atomic commit channels (consensus). The resulting system has low-latency for both confirmation and payment finality. Remarkably, each validator can be sharded across many machines to allow unbounded horizontal scalability.

## HammerHead: Score-based Dynamic Leader Selection[​](#hammerhead-score-based-dynamic-leader-selection "Direct link to HammerHead: Score-based Dynamic Leader Selection")

  * **Link:** <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12713>
  * **Publication:** IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), 2024
  * **Relevance:** The need for high throughput and censorship resistance in blockchain technology has led to research on DAG-based consensus. The Sui blockchain protocol uses a variant of the Bullshark consensus algorithm due to its lower latency, but this leader-based protocol causes performance issues when candidate leaders crash. In this paper, we explore the ideas pioneered by Carousel on providing Leader-Utilization and present HammerHead. Unlike Carousel, which is built with a chained and pipelined consensus protocol in mind, HammerHead does not need to worry about chain quality as it is directly provided by the DAG, but needs to make sure that even though validators might commit blocks in different views the safety and liveness is preserved. Our implementation of HammerHead shows a slight performance increase in a faultless setting, and a drastic 2x latency reduction and up to 40% throughput increase when suffering faults (100 validators, 33 faults).

## Narwhal and Tusk: A DAG-based Mempool and Efficient BFT Consensus[​](#narwhal-and-tusk "Direct link to Narwhal and Tusk: A DAG-based Mempool and Efficient BFT Consensus")

  * **Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11827>
  * **Publication:** EuroSys, 2022
  * **Relevance:** The consensus system that we will likely use to support shared-objects in Sui.
  * **Summary:** We propose separating the task of reliable transaction dissemination from transaction ordering to enable high-performance Byzantine fault-tolerant quorum-based consensus. We design and evaluate a mempool protocol, Narwhal, specializing in high-throughput reliable dissemination and storage of causal histories of transactions. Narwhal tolerates an asynchronous network and maintains high performance despite failures. Narwhal is designed to easily scale-out using multiple workers at each validator, and we demonstrate that there is no foreseeable limit to the throughput we can achieve. Composing Narwhal with a partially synchronous consensus protocol (Narwhal-HotStuff) yields significantly better throughput even in the presence of faults or intermittent loss of liveness due to asynchrony. However, loss of liveness can result in higher latency. To achieve overall good performance when faults occur we design Tusk, a zero-message overhead asynchronous consensus protocol, to work with Narwhal. We demonstrate its high performance under a variety of configurations and faults. As a summary of results, on a WAN, Narwhal-Hotstuff achieves more than 130,000 tx/sec at less than 2-sec latency compared with 1,800 tx/sec at 1-sec latency for Hotstuff. Additional workers increase throughput linearly to 600,000 tx/sec without any latency increase. Tusk achieves 160,000 tx/sec with about 3 seconds latency. Under faults, both protocols maintain high throughput, but Narwhal-HotStuff suffers from increased latency.

## SybilQuorum: Open Distributed Ledgers Through Trust Networks[​](#sybilquorum "Direct link to SybilQuorum: Open Distributed Ledgers Through Trust Networks")

  * **Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12237>
  * **Publication:** Not published
  * **Relevance:** Less related to Sui than the other papers, and the paper is in its early stages. It presents an algorithm to strengthen proof-of-Stake systems (like Sui). The paper is, however, theoretical and not on our roadmap.
  * **Summary:** The Sybil attack plagues all peer-to-peer systems, and modern open distributed ledgers employ a number of tactics to prevent it from proof of work, or other resources such as space, stake or memory, to traditional admission control in permissioned settings. With SybilQuorum we propose an alternative approach to securing an open distributed ledger against Sybil attacks, and ensuring consensus amongst honest participants, leveraging social network based Sybil defenses. We show how nodes expressing their trust relationships through the ledger can bootstrap and operate a value system, and general transaction system, and how Sybil attacks are thwarted. We empirically evaluate our system as a secure Federated Byzantine Agreement System, and extend the theory of those systems to do so.

## Twins: BFT Systems Made Robust[​](#twins "Direct link to Twins: BFT Systems Made Robust")

  * **Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10617>
  * **Publication:** International Conference on Principles of Distributed Systems (OPODIS), 2021
  * **Relevance:** Less related to Sui than the other papers, this provides a way to test implementations of consensus systems, such as Tusk and Bullshark. The paper is, however, theoretical and not on our roadmap.
  * **Summary:** This paper presents Twins, an automated unit test generator of Byzantine attacks. Twins implements three types of Byzantine behaviors: (i) leader equivocation, (ii) double voting, and (iii) losing internal state such as forgetting 'locks' guarding voted values. To emulate interesting attacks by a Byzantine node, it instantiates twin copies of the node instead of one, giving both twins the same identities and network credentials. To the rest of the system, the twins appear indistinguishable from a single node behaving in a 'questionable' manner. Twins can systematically generate Byzantine attack scenarios at scale, execute them in a controlled manner, and examine their behavior. Twins scenarios iterate over protocol rounds and vary the communication patterns among nodes. Twins runs in a production setting within DiemBFT where it can execute 44M Twins-generated scenarios daily. Whereas the system at hand did not manifest errors, subtle safety bugs that were deliberately injected for the purpose of validating the implementation of Twins itself were exposed within minutes. Twins can prevent developers from regressing correctness when updating the codebase, introducing new features, or performing routine maintenance tasks. Twins requires only a thin wrapper over DiemBFT; we thus envision other systems using it. Building on this idea, one new attack and several known attacks against other BFT protocols were materialized as Twins scenarios. In all cases, the target protocols break within fewer than a dozen protocol rounds. Hence it is realistic for the Twins approach to expose the problems.

## Zef: Low-latency, Scalable, Private Payments[​](#zef "Direct link to Zef: Low-latency, Scalable, Private Payments")

  * **Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05671>
  * **Publication:** Not published yet (under submission)
  * **Relevance:** Extends the FastPay design to support objects (rather than accounts), what Sui actually uses. An additional contribution of this paper is to add strong privacy to FastPay transactions (but Sui does not plan to do this).
  * **Summary:** We introduce Zef, the first Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol to support payments in anonymous digital coins at arbitrary scale. Zef follows the communication and security model of FastPay: both protocols are asynchronous, low-latency, linearly-scalable, and powered by partially-trusted sharded validators. Zef further introduces opaque coins represented as off-chain certificates that are bound to user accounts. In order to hide the face values of coins when a payment operation consumes or creates them, Zef uses random commitments and NIZK proofs. Created coins are made unlinkable using the blind and randomizable threshold anonymous credentials of [Coconut](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07344.pdf). To control storage costs associated with coin replay prevention, Zef accounts are designed so that data can be safely removed once an account is deactivated. Besides the specifications and a detailed analysis of the protocol, we are making available an open source implementation of Zef in Rust. Our extensive benchmarks on AWS confirm textbook linear scalability and demonstrate a confirmation time under one second at nominal capacity. Compared to existing anonymous payment systems based on a blockchain, this represents a latency speedup of three orders of magnitude, with no theoretical limit on throughput.

# sui-coin
# SUI Coin

The native asset on Sui is called SUI. The coin uses the capitalized version of SUI to distinguish the coin from the Sui network.

The total supply of SUI is capped at **10,000,000,000** (ten billion coins). A share of SUI total supply became liquid at Mainnet launch, with the remaining coins vesting over the coming years, or distributed as future stake reward subsidies.

The SUI coin serves four purposes on the Sui network:

  * You can stake SUI to participate in the proof-of-stake mechanism.
  * SUI is the asset denomination needed to pay the gas fees required to execute and store transactions or other operations on the Sui network.
  * You can use SUI as a versatile and liquid asset for various applications, including the standard features of money - a unit of account, a medium of exchange, or a store of value - and more complex functionality smart contracts enable, interoperability, and composability across the Sui ecosystem.
  * SUI coins play an important role in governance by acting as a right to participate in on-chain voting on issues such as protocol upgrades.

There is a finite supply of SUI. The balance must support all economic activities to scale as more and more people migrate to the Sui platform. In addition, the presence of a storage fund creates important monetary dynamics, in that higher on-chain data requirements translate into a larger storage fund, reducing the amount of SUI in circulation.

# gas-in-sui
# Gas in Sui

A Sui transaction must pay for both the computational cost of execution and the long-term cost of storing the objects a transaction creates or mutates. Specifically, [Sui Gas Pricing](/concepts/tokenomics/gas-pricing) is such that any transaction pays the following gas fees:

`total_gas_fees = computation_units * reference_gas_price + storage_units * storage_price`

While computation and storage fees are separate, they are conceptually similar in that they each translate computation or storage into SUI terms by multiplying computation or storage units by the relevant price.

Finally, Sui [Storage mechanics](/concepts/tokenomics/storage-fund#storage-fund-rewards) provide storage fee rebates whenever a transaction deletes previously stored objects. Hence, the net fees that a user pays equals gas fees minus the rebates associated with data deletion:

`net_gas_fees = computation_gas_fee + storage_gas_fee - storage_rebate`

The information on net gas fees is displayed in a Sui network explorer for each transaction block:

![Gas Fees displayed on a Sui network explorer](/assets/images/gas-fees-explorer-7ce88e5345b350ca800865cb5c6fd53a.png) _The Gas Fees section for a transaction block displayed on a Sui network explorer_

## Gas prices[​](#gas-prices "Direct link to Gas prices")

The [reference gas price](/concepts/tokenomics/gas-pricing#computation-gas-prices) translates the real-time cost of executing a transaction into SUI units and the validator set updates it at each epoch boundary. Similarly, the [storage price](/concepts/tokenomics/gas-pricing#storage-gas-prices) translates the long-term cost of storing data on chain into SUI units and updates infrequently; often remaining constant for various consecutive epochs. During regular network operations, all Sui users can expect to pay the reference gas price and storage price for computation and storage, respectively.

## Gas units[​](#gas-units "Direct link to Gas units")

Gas units include both

### Computation units[​](#computation "Direct link to Computation units")

Different Sui transactions require varying amounts of computational time for processing and execution. Sui translates these varying operational loads into transaction fees by measuring each transaction in terms of computation units. In general, more complex transactions require more computation units.

Importantly, though, Sui computation gas schedule is built coarsely with a bucketing approach. Two relatively similar transactions translate into the exact same amount of computation units if they are in the same bucket, whereas two relatively different transactions translate into different amounts of computation units if they fall in separate buckets. The smallest bucket maps into 1,000 computation units, meaning that all transactions that fall into the smallest bucket cost 1,000 computation units. The largest bucket maps into 5,000,000 computation units; if a transaction requires more computation units, it aborts.

Using coarse bucketing accomplishes two important goals:

  * Frees you from optimizing your smart contracts to deliver marginal gains in gas costs via "gas golfing" — instead, you can focus on step-function improvements in your products and services.
  * Gives you the freedom to adjust per-instruction gas costs and experiment with new gas metering schemes without creating significant development disruption. This can happen frequently, so it's important that you do not rely on per-instruction gas costs remaining stable over time.

Bucket Lower Threshold| Bucket Upper Threshold| Computation Units  
---|---|---  
0| 1,000| 1,000  
1,001| 5,000| 5,000  
5,001| 10,000| 10,000  
10,001| 20,000| 20,000  
20,001| 50,000| 50,000  
50,001| 200,000| 200,000  
200,001| 1,000,000| 1,000,000  
1,000,001| 5,000,000| 5,000,000  
5,000,001| Infinity| transaction will abort  
  
### Storage units[​](#storage "Direct link to Storage units")

Similarly, Sui transactions vary depending on the amount of new data written into on-chain storage. The variable storage units capture these differences by mapping the amount of bytes held in storage into storage units. The current Sui schedule is linear and maps each byte into 100 storage units. So, for example, a transaction that stores 25 bytes costs 2,500 storage units, while a transaction that stores 75 bytes costs 7,500 units.

Importantly, in the Sui [Storage Fund](/concepts/tokenomics/storage-fund) model users pay up front for the cost of storing data in perpetuity but can also get a partial rebate on previously stored data, if that data is deleted. Hence, the amount of storage fees that you pay can be split into a rebateable and non-rebateable amount. Initially, the rebateable amount equals 99% of the storage fees, while the non-rebateable amount equals the remaining 1%.

### Gas budgets[​](#gas-budgets "Direct link to Gas budgets")

You must submit all transactions need together with a gas budget. This provides a cap to the amount of gas fees you pay, especially because sometimes it might be hard to perfectly forecast how much a transaction costs before you submit it to the Sui network.

The gas budget for a Sui transaction is defined in SUI units and transactions are successfully executed if:

`gas_budget >= max{computation_fees,total_gas_fees}`

If the gas budget does not fulfill this condition, then the transaction fails and a portion of the gas budget is charged. In cases where the `gas_budget` is insufficient for covering `computation_fees`, then the entirety of the `gas_budget` is charged. In cases where `gas_budget` is sufficient for covering `computation_fees` but not the `total_gas_fees`, then a portion of the `gas_budget` corresponding to `computation_fees` and the fees associated with mutating the transaction's input objects are charged.

Ultimately, a successful transaction requires the end user to pay the transaction's `total_gas_fees`. However, since it is challenging to perfectly forecast computation time before the transaction is processed, the `gas_budget` condition also requires the `gas_budget` to be at least as large as the transaction's `computation_fees` in case the transaction aborts. In some cases -- especially in the presence of high storage rebates, and, thus negative net storage fees -- the gas budget might be higher than the total gas fees you pay.

Importantly, the minimum gas budget is 2,000 MIST (.000002 SUI). This ensures validators are compensated with at least 2,000 MIST even if the gas budget is incorrectly specified and the transaction aborts. Additionally, this protects the Sui network from being spammed with a large number of transactions with minimal gas budgets. The maximum gas budget is 50 billion MIST or 50 SUI. This protects the network against overflow of internal multiplications and gas limits for denial of service attacks.

As mentioned previously, the storage rebate currently equals 99% of the originally paid storage fees. Because the gas budget applies to the totality of gas fees, it is often the case that a transaction only goes through if the gas budget is considerably higher than the net gas fees that a user ultimately pays.

### Gas budget examples[​](#gas-budget-examples "Direct link to Gas budget examples")

The following table provides some examples of gas accounting on the Sui network. Within the first two and last two rows, computation units are the same because transactions fall within the same bucket. However, the last two transactions are more complex than the first two and thus fall in a higher bucket. Finally, in the last transaction the storage rebate is large enough to fully offset the transaction gas fees and actually pays the user back a positive amount of SUI.

These examples showcase the importance of the gas budget. The minimum gas budget is the smallest amount a transaction can specify to successfully execute. Importantly, when there is a storage rebate, the minimum gas budget is larger than the amount of net gas fees a user ultimately pays — this is especially stark in the last example where the user receives a positive amount back for executing the transaction. This is because the minimum gas budget must be higher than a transaction's computation fees.

Reference Gas Price| Computation Units| Storage Price| Storage Units| Storage Rebate| Minimum Gas Budget| Net Gas Fees  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Simple transaction storing 10 bytes| 1,000 MIST| 1,000| 75 MIST| 1,000| 0 MIST| 1,075,000 MIST| 1,075,000 MIST  
Simple transaction storing 10 bytes and deleting data| 500 MIST| 1,000| 75 MIST| 1,000| 100,000 MIST| 500,000 MIST| 475,000 MIST  
Complex transaction storing 120 bytes| 1,000 MIST| 5,000| 200 MIST| 12,000| 0 MIST| 7,400,000 MIST| 7,400,000 MIST  
Complex transaction storing 120 bytes and deleting data| 500 MIST| 5,000| 200 MIST| 12,000| 5,000,000 MIST| 2,500,000 MIST| -100,000 MIST

# storage-fund
# Storage Fund

Sui includes an efficient and sustainable economic mechanism for financing data storage, which is important given the ability of Sui to store arbitrarily large amounts of on-chain data.

Financially, on-chain data storage introduces a severe inter-temporal challenge: validators who process and write data into storage today might differ from the future validators needing to store that data. If users paid fees for computation power only at write, then future users would need to subsidize past users for their storage and pay disproportionately high fees. This negative network externality can become highly taxing for Sui in the future if left unaddressed.

Sui economic design includes a storage fund that redistributes storage fees from past transactions to future validators. When users transact on Sui, they pay fees upfront for both computation and storage. The storage fees are deposited into a storage fund used to adjust the share of future stake rewards distributed to validators relative to the users that stake SUI with them. This design provides future Sui validators with viable business models.

## Storage fund rewards[​](#rewards "Direct link to Storage fund rewards")

The Sui delegated proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism calculates total stake as the sum of user stake plus the SUI tokens deposited in the storage fund. Hence, the storage fund receives a proportional share of the overall stake rewards depending on its size relative to total stake. The majority of these stake rewards – a share γ\gammaγ – are paid out to current validators to compensate for storage costs, while the remaining (1−γ)(1-\gamma)(1−γ) rewards are used to reinvest in the fund. In other words, stake rewards accruing to the storage fees submitted by past transactions are paid out to current validators to compensate them for data storage costs. When on-chain storage requirements are high, validators receive substantial additional rewards to compensate for their storage costs. Vice versa when storage requirements are low.

More specifically, the storage fund has three key features:

  * The storage fund is funded by past transactions and functions as a tool for shifting gas fees across different epochs. This ensures that future validators are compensated for their storage costs by the past users who created those storage requirements in the first place.
  * The storage fund pays out only the returns on its capital and does not distribute its principal. That is, in practice, it is as if validators were able to borrow the storage fund’s SUI as additional stake and keep the majority of stake rewards (a γ\gammaγ%). But note that validators do not receive funds directly from the storage fund. This guarantees the fund never loses its capitalization and can survive indefinitely. This feature is further buttressed by the (1−γ)(1-\gamma)(1−γ)% of stake rewards reinvested in the fund.
  * The storage fund includes a _deletion option_. If you delete data, you get a partial refund of the storage fees paid originally. Storage fees exist to pay for storage throughout the data lifecycle. There is no reason to keep charging for storage after deletion of the data, so these fees are rebated.

info

The _deletion option_ should not be confused with deleting past transactions. Activity on Sui is finalized at each epoch boundary and past transactions are immutable and can never be reversed. The type of data that can be deleted is, for example, data corresponding to objects that are no longer live, such as NFT metadata, tickets that have been redeemed, auctions that have concluded, and so on.

## Storage fund mechanics[​](#mechanics "Direct link to Storage fund mechanics")

The storage fund size is fixed throughout each epoch, with its size changing at the epoch boundary according to the net inflows accumulated throughout the epoch. Inflows and outflows correspond to:

  * Inflows from the storage fees paid for transactions executed during the current epoch.
  * Inflows from reinvestments of the fund’s returns into new principal. Specifically, the share (1−γ)(1-\gamma)(1−γ) of stake rewards accrued to the storage fund that is not paid out to validators.
  * Outflows from storage fee rebates paid to users who delete the data associated with past transactions.

The key property of the rebate function is that it limits storage fund outflows to be always less than the original storage flow, at the individual transaction level. This mechanism guarantees that the storage fund is never depleted and that its size moves in line with the amount of data held in storage.

## Storage fund incentives[​](#incentives "Direct link to Storage fund incentives")

The storage fund introduces various desirable incentives into the Sui economy:

  * Its mechanics incentivize users to delete data and obtain a rebate on their storage fees when the cost of storing such data exceeds the value obtained from maintaining that data on-chain. This introduces a useful market-based mechanism where users free storage when it becomes uneconomical for them to keep it.
  * It creates deflationary pressure over the SUI token in that increased activity leads to larger storage requirements and to more SUI being removed from circulation.
  * It is capital efficient in that it is economically equivalent to a rent model where users pay for storage through a pay-per-period model.

# validator-committee
# Validator Committee

A set of independent validators participate on the Sui network, each running its own instance of the Sui software on a separate machine (or a sharded cluster of machines the same entity operates). Each validator handles read and write requests sent by clients, verifying transactions and updating on-chain information.

To learn how to set up and run a Sui Validator node, including how staking and rewards work, see [Sui Validator Node Configuration](/guides/operator/validator-config).

Sui uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) to determine which validators operate the network and their voting power. Validators are incentivized to participate in good faith via a share of transaction fees, staking rewards, and slashing stake and staking rewards in case of misbehavior.

## Epochs[​](#epochs "Direct link to Epochs")

Operation of the Sui network is temporally partitioned into non-overlapping, approximate fixed-duration (~24-hour) epochs. During a particular epoch, the set of validators participating in the network and their voting power is fixed. At an epoch boundary, reconfiguration might occur and can change the set of validators participating in the network and their voting power. Conceptually, reconfiguration starts a new instance of the Sui protocol with the previous epoch's final state as [genesis](/guides/operator/genesis) and the new set of validators as the operators. Besides validator set changes, tokenomics operations such as staking/un-staking, and distribution of staking rewards are also processed at epoch boundaries.

## Quorums[​](#quorums "Direct link to Quorums")

A quorum is a set of validators whose combined voting power is greater than two-thirds (>2/3) of the total during a particular epoch. For example, in a Sui instance operated by four validators that all have the same voting power, any group containing three validators is a quorum.

The quorum size of >2/3 ensures Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). A validator commits a transaction (durably store the transaction and update its internal state with the effects of the transaction) only if it is accompanied by cryptographic signatures from a quorum. Sui calls the combination of the transaction and the quorum signatures on its bytes a _certificate_. The policy of committing only certificates ensures Byzantine fault tolerance: if >2/3 of the validators faithfully follow the protocol, they are guaranteed to eventually agree on both the set of committed certificates and their effects.

## Write requests[​](#write-requests "Direct link to Write requests")

A validator can handle two types of write requests: transactions and certificates. At a high level, a client:

  * Communicates a transaction to a quorum of validators to collect the signatures required to form a certificate.
  * Submits a certificate to a validator to commit state changes on that validator.

### Transactions[​](#transactions "Direct link to Transactions")

When a validator receives a transaction from a client, it first performs transaction validity checks (validity of the sender's signature). If the checks pass, the validator locks all owned-objects and signs the transaction bytes, then returns the signature to the client. The client repeats this process with multiple validators until it has collected signatures on its transaction from a quorum, thereby forming a certificate.

The process of collecting validator signatures on a transaction into a certificate and the process of submitting certificates can be performed in parallel. The client can simultaneously multicast transactions/certificates to an arbitrary number of validators. Alternatively, a client can outsource either or both of these tasks to a third-party service provider. This provider must be trusted for liveness (it can refuse to form a certificate), but not for safety (it cannot change the effects of the transaction, and does not need the user's secret key).

### Certificates / certified transactions[​](#certificates "Direct link to Certificates / certified transactions")

After the client forms a certificate, it submits it to the validators, which perform certificate validity checks. These checks ensure the signers are validators in the current epoch, and the signatures are cryptographically valid. If the checks pass, the validators execute the transaction inside the certificate. Execution of a transaction either succeeds and commits all of its effects or aborts and has no effect other than debiting the transaction's gas input. Some reasons a transaction might abort include an explicit abort instruction, a runtime error such as division by zero, or exceeding the maximum gas budget. Whether it succeeds or aborts, the validator durably stores the certificate indexed by the hash of its inner transaction.

If a client collects a quorum of signatures on the effects of the transaction, then the client has a promise of finality. This means that transaction effects persist on the shared database and are actually committed and visible to everyone by the end of the epoch. This does not mean that the latency is a full epoch, because you can use the effects certificate to convince anyone of the transactions finality, as well as to access the effects and issue new transactions. As with transactions, you can parallelize the process of sharing a certificate with validators and (if desired) outsource to a third-party service provider.

## The role of consensus[​](#the-role-of-consensus "Direct link to The role of consensus")

Sui uses a high-throughput DAG-based consensus engine implementing the Mysticeti algorithm to sequence certified transactions. Consensus produces a series of commits. In each commit, there is a sequence of certified transactions.

The order of transactions in consensus output determines the relative order they can operate on each shared object. Note that executions of transactions touching different shared objects are parallelized on multiple cores.

If total execution cost of transactions in a consensus commit is over a threshold, transactions can be cancelled post consensus to avoid overloading the system.

# data-management
# Data Management

Managing the data on your Sui Full node is critical to ensuring a healthy Sui network. This topic provides a high-level description of data management on Sui Full nodes that you can use to optimize your Full node configuration. For more information about Sui Full nodes, such as pruning policies and archival settings, see [Run a Sui Full Node](/guides/operator/sui-full-node).

## Basic Sui Full node functionality[​](#basic-sui-full-node-functionality "Direct link to Basic Sui Full node functionality")

The minimal version of a Sui Full node executes all of the transactions Sui validators commit. Sui Full nodes also orchestrate the submitting of new transactions to the system:

![Basic Sui Full node functionality](/assets/images/fn-basic-functionality-de64f03dacd46d9c5bafa98dbb6fb421.png)

The preceding image shows how data flows through a Full node:

  1. **`State sync` protocol:** A Sui Full node performs the following to achieve state synchronization: 
     * Retrieves the information about the committed checkpoints via the p2p gossip-like protocol
     * Executes the transactions locally to verify that effects match the effects certified by the quorum of the validators
     * Updates the local state with the latest object values accordingly.
  2. **RPCs:** A Sui Full node exposes Sui RPC endpoints for querying the latest state of the system, including both the latest state metadata (such as, `sui_getProtocolConfig`), and the latest state object data (`sui_getObject)`.
  3. **Transaction submission:** Each Sui Full node orchestrates transaction submission to the quorum of the Sui Validators, and, optionally if configured, locally executes the finalized transactions (called fast path execution), which circumvents the wait for checkpoint synchronization.

## Sui Full node Data and RPC types[​](#sui-full-node-data-and-rpc-types "Direct link to Sui Full node Data and RPC types")

A Sui Full Node stores multiple categories of data in its permanent store.

info

The per-epoch Sui store is beyond the scope of this topic. Sui uses the per-epoch store (resets at the start of each epoch) internally for authority and consensus operations.

Sui Full nodes store the following types of data:

  1. **Transactions with associated effects and events:** Sui uses a unique transaction digest to retrieve information about a transaction, including its effects and emitted events. Sui Full nodes don't require the historic transaction information for basic Full node operations. To conserve drive space, you can enable pruning to remove this historical data.
  2. **Checkpoints:** Sui groups committed transactions in checkpoints, and then uses those checkpoints to achieve state synchronization. Checkpoints keep transaction digests that contain additional integrity metadata. Sui Full nodes don't require data from checkpoints to execute and submit transactions, so you can configure pruning for this data as well.
  3. **Objects:** Transactions that mutate objects create new object versions. Each object has a unique pair of `(objectId, version)` used to identify the object. Sui Full nodes don't require historic object versions to execute and submit transactions, so you can configure your Full node to also prune this data.
  4. **Indexing information:** A Full node default configuration is to post-process the committed transactions: it indexes the committed information to enable efficient aggregation and filtering queries. For example, the indexing can be useful for retrieving all the historic transactions of a given sender, or finding all the objects owned by an address.

Sui Full nodes support more than 40 RPC types that includes the following categories:

  * **General metadata** , such as `sui_getProtocolConfig` and `sui_getChainIdentier`. These requests don't depend on additional indexing and don't require historic data to process.
  * **Direct lookups** , such as `sui_getObject`, `sui_getEvents`. These requests don't depend on additional indexing, but require historic data in some cases, such as `sui_tryGetPastObject` and `sui_getTransactionBlock`.
  * **Accumulation and filtering queries** ,such as `suix_getOwnedObjects` and `suix_getCoins`. These requests depend on additional indexing, and require historic data in some cases, such as `suix_queryTransactionBlocks`.

info

Sui plans to migrate the RPC endpoints that require additional indexing away from Sui Full nodes in the near future. This plan decouples the storage that is backing transaction execution from the storage that is better suited for data indexing.

## Sui Archival data[​](#sui-archival-data "Direct link to Sui Archival data")

A Sui archive instance stores the full Sui transaction history since genesis in a database agnostic format. This includes information about transactions (with client authentication), effects, events, and checkpoints. As such, archival storage can be used for data auditing and for replaying historic transactions.

info

The current archival storage format doesn't include historic object versions.

As a Full node operator, you can [enable archival fallback for your Full node](/guides/operator/sui-full-node#set-up-archival-fallback) by specifying the URL to upload archival data. Currently, Mysten Labs manages a Sui archive and stores it in AWS S3. To ensure a healthy network, we encourage the Sui community to set up additional archives to ensure archival data availability across the network. In a typical configuration, an archive trails behind the latest checkpoint by approximately 10 minutes.

A Full Node that starts from scratch can replay (and thus re-verify) transactions that occurred since Sui genesis from the given archive via [configuring Archival Fallback](/guides/operator/sui-full-node#archival-fallback) in the `fullnode.yaml` configuration file to point to the S3 bucket that stores the archive.

A Sui Full node that fails to retrieve checkpoints from its peers via state sync protocol falls back to downloading the missing checkpoints from its pre-configured archive. This fallback enables a Full node to catch up with the rest of the system regardless of the pruning policies of its peers.

## Sui Full node pruning policies[​](#sui-full-node-pruning-policies "Direct link to Sui Full node pruning policies")

As described previously, sustainable disk usage requires Sui Full nodes to prune the information about historic object versions as well as historic transactions with the corresponding effects and events, including old checkpoint data.

Both transaction and object pruners run in the background. The logical deletion of entries from RocksDB ultimately triggers the physical compaction of data on disk, which is governed by RocksDB background jobs: the pruning effect on disk usage is not immediate and might take multiple days.

To learn more about object pruning policies, see [Object pruning](/guides/operator/sui-full-node#object-pruning). You can configure the pruner in two modes:

  * **aggressive pruning** (`num-epochs-to-retain: 0`): Preferred option. Sui prunes old object versions as soon as possible.
  * **epoch-based pruning** (`num-epochs-to-retain: X`): Sui prunes old object versions after X epochs.

tip

Testing indicates that aggressive pruning results in more efficient Full Node operation.

To learn more about transaction pruning policies, see [Transaction pruning](/guides/operator/sui-full-node#transaction-pruning). To configure transaction pruning, specify the `num-epochs-to-retain-for-checkpoints: X` config option. The checkpoints, including their transactions, effects and events are pruned up to X epochs ago. We suggest setting transaction pruning to 2 epochs.

### Set an archiving watermark[​](#set-an-archiving-watermark "Direct link to Set an archiving watermark")

In case your Full node is configured to upload committed information to an archive, you should ensure that pruning doesn't occur until after the corresponding data is uploaded. To do so, set the `use-for-pruning-watermark: true` in the Fullnode.yaml file as described in [Archival fallback](/guides/operator/sui-full-node#archival-fallback).

## Sui Full node key-value store backup[​](#sui-full-node-key-value-store-backup "Direct link to Sui Full node key-value store backup")

To enable historic data queries for the Sui Full nodes that prune old transactional data, Full node RPC implementation is configured to fallback for querying missing transactional data from a remote store.

If the information about the transaction digest, effects, events, or checkpoints is not available locally, a Full node automatically retrieves the historical data from a cloud-based key-value store (currently managed by MystenLabs). Note that the current key-value store implementation keeps historic transactional data only: we plan to provide support for a similar setup for retrieving the historic object versions in a future release.

## Object pruning[​](#object-pruning "Direct link to Object pruning")

Sui adds new object versions to the database as part of transaction execution. This makes previous versions ready for garbage collection. However, without pruning, this can result in database performance degradation and requires large amounts of storage space. Sui identifies the objects that are eligible for pruning in each checkpoint, and then performs the pruning in the background.

You can enable pruning for a Sui node by adding the `authority-store-pruning-config` config to `fullnode.yaml` file:

```

    
    
    authority-store-pruning-config:# Number of epoch dbs to keep # Not relevant for object pruningnum-latest-epoch-dbs-to-retain:3# The amount of time, in seconds, between running the object pruning task.# Not relevant for object pruningepoch-db-pruning-period-secs:3600# Number of epochs to wait before performing object pruning.# When set to 0, Sui prunes old object versions as soon# as possible. This is also called *aggressive pruning*, and results in the most effective# garbage collection method with the lowest disk usage possible. # This is the recommended setting for Sui Validator nodes since older object versions aren't# necessary to execute transactions.# When set to 1, Sui prunes only object versions from transaction checkpoints# previous to the current epoch. In general, when set to N (where N >= 1), Sui prunes # only object versions from checkpoints up to `current - N` epoch. # It is therefore possible to have multiple versions of an object present # in the database. This setting is recommended for Sui Full nodes as they might need to serve # RPC requests that require looking up objects by ID and Version (rather than just latest# version). However, if your Full node does not serve RPC requests you should then also enable # aggressive pruning.num-epochs-to-retain:1# Advanced setting: Maximum number of checkpoints to prune in a batch. The default# settings are appropriate for most use cases.max-checkpoints-in-batch:10# Advanced setting: Maximum number of transactions in one batch of pruning run. The default# settings are appropriate for most use cases.max-transactions-in-batch:1000
```

## Transaction pruning[​](#transaction-pruning "Direct link to Transaction pruning")

Transaction pruning removes previous transactions and effects from the database. Sui periodically creates checkpoints. Each checkpoint contains the transactions that occurred during the checkpoint and their associated effects.

Sui performs transaction pruning in the background after checkpoints complete.

You can enable transaction pruning for your Full node or Validator node by adding `num-epochs-to-retain-for-checkpoints` to the `authority-store-pruning-config` config for the node:

```

    
    
    authority-store-pruning-config:num-latest-epoch-dbs-to-retain:3epoch-db-pruning-period-secs:3600num-epochs-to-retain:0max-checkpoints-in-batch:10max-transactions-in-batch:1000# Number of epochs to wait before performing transaction pruning.# When this is N (where N >= 2), Sui prunes transactions and effects from # checkpoints up to the `current - N` epoch. Sui never prunes transactions and effects from the current and# immediately prior epoch. N = 2 is a recommended setting for Sui Validator nodes and Sui Full nodes that don't # serve RPC requests.num-epochs-to-retain-for-checkpoints:2# Ensures that individual database files periodically go through the compaction process.# This helps reclaim disk space and avoid fragmentation issuesperiodic-compaction-threshold-days:1
```

info

If you prune transactions, Archival nodes can help ensure lagging peer nodes don't lose any information. For more information, see [Sui Archives](/guides/operator/archives).

## Pruning policy examples[​](#pruning-policy-examples "Direct link to Pruning policy examples")

Use the examples in this section to configure your Sui Full node. You can copy the examples, and then, optionally, modify the values as appropriate for your environment.

### Validator and minimal Full node[​](#validator-and-minimal-full-node "Direct link to Validator and minimal Full node")

This configuration keeps disk usage to a minimum. It is suitable for most validators. A Full node with this configuration cannot answer queries that require indexing or historic data.

```

    
    
    # Do not generate or maintain indexing of Sui data on the nodeenable-index-processing:falseauthority-store-pruning-config:# default valuesnum-latest-epoch-dbs-to-retain:3epoch-db-pruning-period-secs:3600max-checkpoints-in-batch:10max-transactions-in-batch:1000# end of default values# Prune historic object versions as soon as possible.num-epochs-to-retain:0# Prune historic transactions of the past epochsnum-epochs-to-retain-for-checkpoints:2periodic-compaction-threshold-days:1# Smooth pruning traffic throughout an epochsmooth:true
```

### Full node with indexing but no history[​](#full-node-with-indexing-but-no-history "Direct link to Full node with indexing but no history")

This setup manages secondary indexing in addition to the latest state, but aggressively prunes historic data. A Full node with this configuration:

  * Answers RPC queries that require indexing, like `suix_getBalance()`.
  * Answers RPC queries that require historic transactions via a fallback to retrieve the data from a remote key-value store: `sui_getTransactionBlock()`.
  * Cannot answer RPC queries that require historic object versions: `sui_tryGetPastObject()`. 
    * The `showBalanceChanges` filter of `sui_getTransactionBlock()` query relies on historic object versions, so it can't work with this configuration.

```

    
    
    authority-store-pruning-config:# default valuesnum-latest-epoch-dbs-to-retain:3epoch-db-pruning-period-secs:3600max-checkpoints-in-batch:10max-transactions-in-batch:1000# end of default values# Prune historic object versionsnum-epochs-to-retain:0# Prune historic transactions of the past epochsnum-epochs-to-retain-for-checkpoints:2periodic-compaction-threshold-days:1# Smooth pruning traffic throughout an epochsmooth:true
```

### Full node with full object history but pruned transaction history[​](#full-node-with-full-object-history-but-pruned-transaction-history "Direct link to Full node with full object history but pruned transaction history")

This configuration manages the full object history while still pruning historic transactions. A Full node with this configuration can answer all historic and indexing queries (using the transaction query fallback for transactional data), including the ones that require historic objects such as the `showBalanceChanges` filter of `sui_getTransactionBlock()`.

The main caveat is that the current setup enables **transaction pruner** to go ahead of **object pruner**. The object pruner might not be able to properly clean up the objects modified by the transactions that have been already pruned. You should closely monitor the disk space growth on a Full node with this configuration.

In addition to the regular (pruned) snapshots, Mysten Labs also maintains special RocksDB snapshots with full history of object versions available for the operators using this configuration.

```

    
    
    authority-store-pruning-config:# default valuesnum-latest-epoch-dbs-to-retain:3epoch-db-pruning-period-secs:3600max-checkpoints-in-batch:10max-transactions-in-batch:1000# end of default values# No pruning of object versions (use u64::max for num of epochs)num-epochs-to-retain:18446744073709551615# Prune historic transactions of the past epochsnum-epochs-to-retain-for-checkpoints:2periodic-compaction-threshold-days:1# Smooth pruning traffic throughout an epochsmooth:true

# local-network
# Connect to a Local Network

Use a Sui local network to test your dApps against the latest changes to Sui, and to prepare for the next Sui release to the Devnet or Testnet network. Sui CLI provides the `sui start` command to start a local network. There are several services that can be started when using `sui start`, such as an indexer, a faucet, or a local instance of the GraphQL service (including the web-based GraphiQL IDE). You can use the included faucet to get test SUI to use on the local network.

If you haven't already, you need to [install Sui CLI](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) on your system.

## Start the local network[​](#start-the-local-network "Direct link to Start the local network")

To start the local network, run the following command after you install Sui CLI.

```

    
    
    RUST_LOG="off,sui_node=info" sui start --with-faucet --force-regenesis
```

This command:

  * Calls the Sui CLI binary with two flags:
  * `--with-faucet` to start a faucet service.
  * `--force-regenesis` to generate a new genesis and not persist the local network state.
  * Instructs Rust to set specific logging through the `RUST_LOG`=`off,sui_node=info` flags, which turns off logging for all components except `sui-node`. If you want to see more detailed logs, you can remove `RUST_LOG` from the command.

info

Each time you start the network by passing `--force-regenesis`, the local network starts from a random genesis with no previous data, and the local network is not persisted. If you'd like to persist data, skip passing the `--force-regenesis` flag. For more details, see the [Persist local network state](#persist-local-network-state) section.

To customize your local Sui network, such as starting other services or changing default ports and hosts, include additional flags or options in the `sui start` command.

info

Options and flags like `with-indexer`, `with-graphql`, and related require you to have Postgresq/libpq installed. Check out the list of possible options below to find which is the default expected DB, or how to pass a different DB.

The following is a list of possible options and flags to pass to `sui start`:

```

    
    
      --network.config <CONFIG_DIR>      Config directory that will be used to store network config, node db, keystore sui genesis -f --with-faucet generates a genesis config that can be used to start this process. Use with caution as the `-f` flag                       will overwrite the existing config directory. We can use any config dir that is generated by the `sui genesis`  --force-regenesis            A new genesis is created each time this flag is set, and state is not persisted between runs. Only use this flag when you want to start the network from scratch every time you run this command  --with-graphql[=<WITH_GRAPHQL>]     Start a GraphQL server on localhost and port: 127.0.0.1:9125, or on the port provided. When providing a specific value, please use the = sign between the flag and value: `--with-graphql=6125`. Note that                       GraphQL requires a running indexer  --with-faucet[=<WITH_FAUCET>]      Start a faucet with default host and port: 127.0.0.1:9123, or on the port provided. When providing a specific value, please use the = sign between the flag and value: `--with-faucet=6123`  --with-indexer[=<WITH_INDEXER>]     Start an indexer with default host and port: 0.0.0.0:9124, or on the port provided. When providing a specific value, please use the = sign between the flag and value: `--with-faucet=6124`.                     The indexer be started in writer mode and reader mode  --fullnode-rpc-port <FULLNODE_RPC_PORT> Port to start the Fullnode RPC server on. Default port is 9000 [default: 9000]  --pg-port <PG_PORT>           Port for the Indexer Postgres DB. Default port is 5432 [default: 5432]  --pg-host <PG_HOST>           Hostname for the Indexer Postgres DB. Default host is localhost [default: localhost]  --pg-db-name <PG_DB_NAME>        DB name for the Indexer Postgres DB. Default DB name is sui_indexer [default: sui_indexer]  --pg-user <PG_USER>           DB username for the Indexer Postgres DB. Default username is postgres [default: postgres]  --pg-password <PG_PASSWORD>       DB password for the Indexer Postgres DB. Default password is postgrespw [default: postgrespw]  --epoch-duration-ms <EPOCH_DURATION_MS> Set the epoch duration. Can only be used when `--force-regenesis` flag is passed or if there's no genesis config and one will be auto-generated. When this flag is not set but `--force-regenesis` is set, the                       epoch duration will be set to 60 seconds  --no-full-node              Start the network without a fullnode-h, --help                  Print help (see more with '--help')
```

Use `sui start --help` to see these options in your console.

### Persist local network state[​](#persist-local-network-state "Direct link to Persist local network state")

By default, when using `sui start` the command uses an existing genesis and network configuration if the `~/.sui/sui_config` folder exists and includes a `genesis.blob` file. If the folder doesn't exist, it creates the folder and generates a new genesis configuration. If you pass `--network.config`, the command checks for the network config file and tries to load the genesis blob as per the network config file.

Whenever you stop and start the network without passing the `--force-regenesis` flag, all history is preserved and accessible.

info

To generate a custom genesis, use the `sui genesis` command and pass the desired custom values. For more information about possible flags and options, run `sui genesis --help`.

### Access your local Full node[​](#access-your-local-full-node "Direct link to Access your local Full node")

Use the following command to retrieve the total transaction count from your local network:

```

    
    
    curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9000' \--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \--data-raw '{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "sui_getTotalTransactionBlocks", "params": []}'
```

If successful, the response resembles the following:

```

    
    
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":168,"id":1}
```

## Connect the Sui CLI to your local network[​](#connect-the-sui-cli-to-your-local-network "Direct link to Connect the Sui CLI to your local network")

You can use the Sui CLI with any Sui network. By default it connects to Sui Devnet. To connect to your local network, create a new environment alias named `local` that sets the RPC URL the client uses to your local network.

```

    
    
    sui client new-env --alias local --rpc http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

Next, use the following command to set the active environment to the new `local` environment you created.

```

    
    
    sui client switch --env local
```

The command returns:

`Active environment switched to [local]`

You can check the current active environment with the following command:

```

    
    
    sui client active-env
```

The command returns:

`local`

## Show the current active address[​](#show-the-current-active-address "Direct link to Show the current active address")

The Sui Client CLI uses the active address for command if you don't specify one. Use the following command to show the active address on your local network.

```

    
    
    sui client active-address
```

The command returns an address, for example:

`0xbc33e6e4818f9f2ef77d020b35c24be738213e64d9e58839ee7b4222029610de`

Use the active address to get test SUI to use on your local network. Use the `sui client addresses` command to see all of the addresses on your local network.

info

The address returned when you run the command is unique and does not match the one used in this example.

## Use the local faucet[​](#use-the-local-faucet "Direct link to Use the local faucet")

Transactions on your local network require SUI coins to pay for gas fees just like other networks. You can use the active address with the faucet.

Sui CLI provides the `sui client faucet` command to get coins from the faucet. In the most basic case, run `sui client faucet` and wait up to 60 seconds for the coins to reach your address. Use `sui client gas` to check for the new coins.

info

The `faucet` command uses the active address and the active network environment by default. If you need to pass in a different address or faucet server URL, check the `help` menu. If you're using a different network than a local network or the public ones (`fullnode.network.sui.io`), pass the URL to the faucet server.

### Check the gas coin objects for the active address[​](#check-the-gas-coin-objects-for-the-active-address "Direct link to Check the gas coin objects for the active address")

After you get coins from the faucet, use the following command to view the coin objects for the address:

```

    
    
    sui client gas
```

The response resembles the following, but with different IDs:

```

    
    
    ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────────╮│ gasCoinId                             │ gasBalance │├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────┤│ 0x1d790713c1c3441a307782597c088f11230c47e609af2cec97f393123ea4de45 │ 200000000 ││ 0x20c1d5ad2e8693953fca09fd2fec0fbc52a787e0a0f77725220d36a09a5b312d │ 200000000 ││ 0x236714566110f5624516faa0da215ad29f8daa611e8b651d1e972168207567b2 │ 200000000 ││ 0xc81f30256bb04ad84bc4a92017cffd7c1f98286e028fa504d8515ad72ddd1088 │ 200000000 ││ 0xf61c8b21b305cc8e062b3a37de8c3a37583e17f437a449a2ab42321d019aeeb4 │ 200000000 │╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────╯
```

## Generate example data[​](#generate-example-data "Direct link to Generate example data")

Use the TypeScript SDK to add example data to your network. Run the following command from the `sui` root folder:

```

    
    
    pnpm --filter @mysten/sui test:e2e
```

For additional information about example data for testing, see <https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sdk/typescript#testing>.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

If you do not use [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/de/blog/announcements/v18-release-announce), you might see the following message:

`Retrying requesting from faucet: Retry failed: fetch is not defined`

To resolve this, switch or update to Node.js 18 and then try again.

## Test with the Sui TypeScript SDK[​](#test-with-the-sui-typescript-sdk "Direct link to Test with the Sui TypeScript SDK")

The published version of the Sui TypeScript SDK might be an earlier version than the version of Sui you installed for your local network. To make sure you're using the latest version of the SDK, use the `experimental`-tagged version (for example, `0.0.0-experimental-20230317184920`) in the [Current Tags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysten/sui?activeTab=versions) section of the Sui NPM registry.

# Connect to a Sui Network

Sui has Mainnet, Devnet, and Testnet networks available. You can use one of the test networks, Devnet or Testnet, to experiment with the version of Sui running on that network. You can also spin up a [local Sui network](/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network) for local development.

The Sui Testnet and Devnet networks consist of several validator nodes to validate each network's transactions. Clients send transactions and read requests via this endpoint: `https://fullnode.<SUI-NETWORK-VERSION>.sui.io:443` using [JSON-RPC](/references/sui-api/json-rpc-format).

You can [request test SUI tokens](#request-test-tokens) through the Sui [devnet-faucet](https://discordapp.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) and [testnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) Discord channels, depending on which version of the network you use. If connected to Localnet, use cURL to request tokens from your [local faucet](/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network#use-the-local-faucet). The coins on these networks have no financial value. There is no faucet service for Mainnet.

See announcements about Sui in the [#announcements](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/925109817834631189) Discord channel.

See the [terms of service](https://sui.io/terms/) for using Sui networks.

info

Testnet and Devnet data persistence is not guaranteed. Devnet data is wiped regularly as part of scheduled software updates. The data on Testnet persists through the regular update process, but might be wiped when necessary. Testnet data wipes are announced ahead of time.

For more information about the release schedule of Sui networks, see [Sui Network Release](https://sui.io/networkinfo/).

## Sui CLI[​](#sui-cli "Direct link to Sui CLI")

Sui provides [Sui command line interface (CLI)](/references/cli/client) to interact with Sui networks:

  * Create and manage your private keys
  * Create example NFTs
  * Call and publish Move modules

## Environment set up[​](#environment-set-up "Direct link to Environment set up")

First, [Install Sui](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install#install-binaries). After you install Sui, [request SUI test tokens](#request-gas-tokens) through Discord for the network you are using: [Devnet](https://discordapp.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) or [Testnet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966). If connected to Localnet, use cURL to request tokens from your [local faucet](/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network#use-the-local-faucet).

To check whether Sui is already installed, run the following command:

```

    
    
    which sui
```

If Sui is installed, the command returns the path to the Sui binary. If Sui is not installed, it returns `sui not found`.

See the [Sui Releases](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases) page to view the changes in each Sui release.

## Configure Sui client[​](#configure-sui-client "Direct link to Configure Sui client")

If you previously ran `sui genesis` to create a local network, it created a Sui client configuration file (client.yaml) that connects to `localhost` at `http://0.0.0.0:9000`. See [Connect to a custom RPC endpoint](#connect-to-a-custom-rpc-endpoint) to update the client.yaml file.

To connect the Sui client to a network, run the following command:

```

    
    
    sui client
```

If you receive the `sui-client` help output in the console, you already have a client.yaml file. See [Connect to a custom RPC endpoint](#connect-to-a-custom-rpc-endpoint) to add a new environment alias or to switch the currently active network.

The first time you start Sui client without having a client.yaml file, the console displays the following message:

```

    
    
    Config file ["<PATH-TO-FILE>/client.yaml"] doesn't exist, do you want to connect to a Sui Full node server [y/N]?
```

Press **y** and then press **Enter**. The process then requests the RPC server URL:

```

    
    
    Sui Full node server URL (Defaults to Sui Testnet if not specified) :
```

Press **Enter** to connect to Sui Testnet. To use a custom RPC server, Sui Devnet, or Sui Mainnet, enter the URL to the correct RPC endpoint and then press **Enter**.

If you enter a URL, the process prompts for an alias for the environment:

```

    
    
    Environment alias for [<URL-ENTERED>] :
```

Type an alias name and press **Enter**.

```

    
    
    Select key scheme to generate keypair (0 for ed25519, 1 for secp256k1, 2 for secp256r1):
```

Press **0** , **1** , or **2** to select a key scheme and the press **Enter**.

Sui returns a message similar to the following (depending on the key scheme you selected) that includes the address and 12-word recovery phrase for the address:

```

    
    
    Generated new keypair for address with scheme "ed25519" [0xb9c83a8b40d3263c9ba40d551514fbac1f8c12e98a4005a0dac072d3549c2442]Secret Recovery Phrase : [cap wheat many line human lazy few solid bored proud speed grocery]
```

### Connect to a custom RPC endpoint[​](#connect-to-a-custom-rpc-endpoint "Direct link to Connect to a custom RPC endpoint")

If you previously used `sui genesis` with the force option (`-f` or `--force`), your client.yaml file already includes two RPC endpoints: `localnet` at `http://0.0.0.0:9000` and `devnet` at `https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443`. You can view the defined environments with the `sui client envs` command, and switch between them with the `sui client switch` command.

If you previously installed a Sui client that connected to a Sui network, or created a local network, you can modify your existing client.yaml file to change the configured RPC endpoint. The `sui client` commands that relate to environments read from and write to the client.yaml file.

To check currently available environment aliases, run the following command:

```

    
    
    sui client envs
```

The command outputs the available environment aliases, with `(active)` denoting the currently active network.

```

    
    
    localnet => http://0.0.0.0:9000 (active)devnet => https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443
```

To add a new alias for a custom RPC endpoint, run the following command. Replace values in `<` `>` with values for your installation:

```

    
    
    sui client new-env --alias <ALIAS> --rpc <RPC-SERVER-URL>
```

To switch the active network, run the following command:

```

    
    
    sui client switch --env <ALIAS>
```

If you encounter an issue, delete the Sui configuration directory (`~/.sui/sui_config`) and reinstall the latest [Sui binaries](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install#install-sui-binaries).

# sui-move-concepts
# Move Concepts

Move is an open source language for writing safe packages to manipulate on-chain objects (sometimes referred to as "smart contracts"). Move is a platform-agnostic language to enable common libraries, tooling, and developer communities across blockchains with vastly different data and execution models. Move is adaptable to meet the needs of the blockchain the code operates on, see [Move on Sui](/concepts/sui-move-concepts#differences) to review enhancements made to Move for optimization on the Sui blockchain.

You can use Move to define, create, and manage programmable Sui objects representing user-level assets. Sui's object system is implemented by adding new functionality to Move while also imposing additional restrictions. See [Object Model](/concepts/object-model) for more details.

## Move on Sui[​](#move-on-sui "Direct link to Move on Sui")

Move on Sui contains some important differences from Move on other blockchains. Sui takes advantage of Move's security and flexibility and enhances it with the features described in the following sections to vastly improve throughput, reduce delays in finality, and make Move programming more approachable. For full details, see the [Sui Smart Contracts Platform](/assets/files/sui-6251a5c5b9d2fab6b1df0e24ba7c6322.pdf) white paper.

tip

Where the Sui documentation refers to the Move language, the content is documenting the specific Move implementation on the Sui blockchain. If relevant, the documentation expressly refers to the original use case for the Move language as Move on Diem.

In general, Move on Diem code written for other systems works in Sui with these exceptions:

## Key differences[​](#differences "Direct link to Key differences")

Key differences with Move on Sui include:

  * Sui uses its own [object-centric global storage](#global-storage)
  * Addresses represent [Object IDs](#object-ids)
  * Sui objects have [globally unique IDs](#global-unique)
  * Sui has [module initializers](#module-initializers) (init)
  * Sui [entry points](#entry-points) take object references as input

### Object-centric global storage[​](#global-storage "Direct link to Object-centric global storage")

In Move on Diem, global storage is part of the programming model. Resources and modules are held in global storage, owned by an account which has an address. Transactions are free to access resources from any account in global storage when they run, using special operations such as `move_to` and `move_from`.

This approach introduces a scaling issue, as it is not possible to statically determine which transactions are contending over the same resource and which are not. This is similar to the scaling issues faced by other blockchains where smart contracts typically store account information in large, internal mappings, which limit throughput.

Move on Sui addresses the scaling issue by not having global storage, or its related operations. When objects (in contrast to resources) and packages (sets of modules) are stored on Sui, they are each given unique identifiers. All a transaction's inputs are explicitly specified up-front using these unique identifiers, to allow the chain to schedule transactions with non-overlapping inputs in parallel.

### Addresses represent Object IDs[​](#object-ids "Direct link to Addresses represent Object IDs")

In Move on Diem, there is a 16-byte `address` type used to represent account addresses in global storage. A 16 byte address is sufficient for the Move on Diem security model.

Sui doesn't have global storage, so `address` is re-purposed as a 32-byte identifier used for both objects and accounts. Each transaction is signed by an account (the "sender") that is accessible from the transaction context, and each object stores its `address` wrapped in its `id: UID` field. (Refer to [object.move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/object.move) in the Sui framework for details).

### Object with key ability, globally unique IDs[​](#global-unique "Direct link to Object with key ability, globally unique IDs")

In Move on Diem, the `key` ability indicates that the type is a resource, meaning it (along with an account address) can be used as a key in global storage.

On Sui, the `key` ability indicates that a struct is an object type and comes with an additional requirement that the first field of the struct has signature `id: UID`, to contain the object's unique address on-chain. Sui's bytecode verifier ensures that new objects are always assigned fresh `UID`s (identifiers are never re-used).

### Module initializers[​](#module-initializers "Direct link to Module initializers")

As described in [Object-centric global storage](#global-storage), you publish Move modules into Sui storage. The Sui runtime executes a special [initializer function](/concepts/sui-move-concepts/init) you optionally define in a module only once at the time of module publication to pre-initialize module-specific data (for example, creating singleton objects).

### Entry points take object references as input[​](#entry-points "Direct link to Entry points take object references as input")

You can call public functions from Sui transactions (called programmable transaction blocks). These functions can take objects by value, by immutable reference, or by mutable reference. If taken by value, you can destroy the object, wrap it (in another object), or transfer it (to a Sui ID specified by an address). If taken by mutable reference, the modified version of the object saves to storage without any change in ownership. In any case, the Sui network authenticates the object and declares it's usage as a part of the transaction.

In addition to calling public functions, you can call a function that is marked [entry](/concepts/sui-move-concepts/entry-functions) even if it is private as long as other non-`entry` functions have not used its inputs.

## Explore concepts[​](#explore-concepts "Direct link to Explore concepts")

Some of the features of Move are defined in this section using commented code examples.

### Init[​](#init "Direct link to Init")

The `init` function is a special function that executes only once - when you publish the associated module. See [Init](/concepts/sui-move-concepts/init) for details.

### Entry functions[​](#entry-functions "Direct link to Entry functions")

The `entry` modifier for functions enables safe and direct invocation of module functions, much like scripts. See [Entry](/concepts/sui-move-concepts/entry-functions) for details.

### Strings[​](#strings "Direct link to Strings")

Move does not have a native type for strings, but it has a useful wrapper. See [Strings](/concepts/sui-move-concepts/strings) for examples.

### One-time witness[​](#one-time-witness "Direct link to One-time witness")

A one-time witness (OTW) is a special instance of a type created in the module initializer and guaranteed to be unique with only one instance. See [One-Time Witness](/concepts/sui-move-concepts/one-time-witness) for an example.

  7. Add the folder containing the extracted files to your `PATH` variable. There are several ways to get to the setting depending on your version of Windows. One way that works on all versions of Windows is to type `sysdm.cpl` in a console to open the System Properties window. Under the **Advanced** tab, click the **Environment Variables...** button.

  8. In the Environment Variables window, select the `Path` variable and click the **Edit...** button.

  9. In the Edit environment variable window, click **New** and add the path to your expanded folder. Using the example path, this would be `C:\sui`.

  10. Click **OK**.

info

Running binaries other than `sui` might require installing prerequisites itemized in the following section.

#### Confirm the installation[​](#confirm-the-installation "Direct link to Confirm the installation")

To confirm that Sui installed correctly, type `sui --version` in your console or terminal and press Enter. The response should provide the Sui version installed. If the console or terminal responds with a command not found error, make sure the full path to your Sui binaries is included in your `PATH` variable.

## Install from Cargo[​](#install-sui-binaries-from-source "Direct link to Install from Cargo")

Run the following command to install Sui binaries from the `testnet` branch:

```

    
    
    cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui
```

The install process can take a while to complete. You can monitor installation progress in the terminal. If you encounter an error, make sure to install the latest version of all prerequisites and then try the command again.

To update to the latest stable version of Rust:

```

    
    
    rustup update stable
```

The command installs Sui components in the `~/.cargo/bin` folder.

## Upgrade from Cargo[​](#upgrade-from-cargo "Direct link to Upgrade from Cargo")

If you previously installed the Sui binaries, you can update them to the most recent release with the same command you used to install them (changing `testnet` to the desired branch):

```

    
    
    cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui
```

## Build from source[​](#build-from-source "Direct link to Build from source")

Follow the instructions in this topic to install the Rust crates (packages) required to interact with Sui networks, including the Sui CLI.

To install Sui from source, you first need to install its [prerequisites](#prerequisites) for your operating system. After installing the supporting technologies, you can install [Sui binaries from source](#install-sui-binaries-from-source).

You can also download the [source code](/references/contribute/sui-environment) to have local access to files.

#### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Your system needs the following prerequisites available to successfully install Sui.

#### Rust and Cargo[​](#rust-and-cargo "Direct link to Rust and Cargo")

Sui requires Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) on all supported operating systems. The suggested method to install Rust is with `rustup` using cURL.

Some other commands in the installation instructions also require cURL to run. If you can't run the cURL command to install Rust, see the instructions to install cURL for your operating system in the following section before you install Rust.

Use the following command to install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux:

```

    
    
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you use Windows 11, see information about using the [Rust installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on the Rust website. The installer checks for C++ build tools and prompts you to install them if necessary. Select the option that best defines your environment and follow the instructions in the install wizard.

For additional installation options, see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Sui uses the latest version of Cargo to build and manage dependencies. See the [Cargo installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) page on the Rust website for more information.

Use the following command to update Rust with `rustup`:

```

    
    
    rustup update stable
```

# get-address
# Get Sui Address

An address is a way to uniquely and anonymously identify an account that exists on the Sui blockchain network. In other words, an address is a way for a user to store and use tokens on the Sui network, without providing any personally identifying information (such as email address, phone number, and so on). For example, if you want to purchase a number of SUI tokens to play a game, you must specify an address where these tokens are to be deposited.

The Sui address is unique, similarly to the way a social security number or a personal identification number is unique to one person. However, in Sui you can create and own multiple addresses, all of which are unique.

In Sui, an address is 32 bytes and is often encoded in hexadecimal with a `0x` prefix. For example, this is a valid Sui address: `0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e591bd9d636e7895dcfc8de05f331`. You can use a Sui network explorer to find more information about this address and the objects it owns.

If you'd like to understand how a Sui address is derived from private keys and other cryptography related topics, see the [Keys and Addresses](/concepts/cryptography/transaction-auth/keys-addresses) topic.

## How to obtain a Sui address[​](#how-to-obtain-a-sui-address "Direct link to How to obtain a Sui address")

Sui provides multiple ways to obtain a Sui address. The following are the two most common.

### Sui Wallet[​](#sui-wallet "Direct link to Sui Wallet")

One of the most straightforward ways to obtain a Sui address for first-time users is through the [Sui Wallet Chrome browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil). After you install the extension, there are several ways to create an address.

Open the Chrome Sui Wallet browser extension and then:

  * Use your gmail/twitch/facebook account (ZkLogin) and follow the on-screen instructions
  * Click **More Options** → **Create a new passphrase account**. Then follow the on-screen instructions.

For more information on the Sui Wallet and how to keep it secure, see the [Sui Wallet documentation](https://mysten-docs-site.vercel.app/wallet).

### Command line interface[​](#command-line-interface "Direct link to Command line interface")

If you are using the Sui command line interface (CLI) to interact with the Sui network, you can use the `sui client` command to generate a new address. By default, when the Sui CLI runs for the first time it will prompt you to set up your local wallet, and then it generates one Sui address and the associated secret recovery phrase. Make sure you write down the secret recovery phrase and store it in a safe place.

To generate a new Sui address use `sui client new-address ed25519`, which specifies the keypair scheme flag to be of type `ed25519`.

For more information, see the [Sui Client CLI](/references/cli/client) documentation.

To see all the generated addresses in the local wallet on your machine, run `sui keytool list`. For more information about the keytool options, see the [Sui Keytool CLI](/references/cli/keytool) documentation.

danger

The private keys associated with the Sui addresses are stored locally on the machine where the CLI is installed, in the `~/.sui/sui_config/sui.keystore` file. Make sure you do not expose this to anyone, as they can use it to get access to your account.

# get-coins
# Get SUI Tokens

Sui faucet is a helpful tool where Sui developers can get free test SUI tokens to deploy and interact with their programs on Sui's Devnet and Testnet networks. There is no faucet for Sui Mainnet.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To request tokens from the faucet, you must own a wallet address that can receive the SUI tokens. See the [Get Sui Address](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-address) topic if you don't already have an address or need to create a new one.

## Request test tokens via the CLI[​](#request-test-tokens-via-the-cli "Direct link to Request test tokens via the CLI")

If you are using the Devnet or Testnet networks, or you spun up a local network, you can use the [Sui CLI](/references/cli/client) to request tokens for your address. The `sui client faucet` uses the active network and active address that is currently set in the Sui CLI by default, but you can specify custom data through the following two arguments:

  * `--address` argument to provide a specific address (or its alias),
  * `--url` argument to provide a custom faucet endpoint.

## Request test tokens through Discord[​](#request-test-tokens-through-discord "Direct link to Request test tokens through Discord")

  1. Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/sui). If you try to join the Sui Discord channel using a newly created Discord account, you may need to wait a few days for validation.
  2. Request test SUI tokens in the Sui [#devnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) or [#testnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) Discord channels. Send the following message to the channel with your client address: `!faucet <Your client address>`

## Request test tokens through wallet[​](#request-test-tokens-through-wallet "Direct link to Request test tokens through wallet")

You can request test tokens within [Sui Wallet](https://github.com/MystenLabs/mysten-app-docs/blob/main/mysten-sui-wallet.md#add-sui-tokens-to-your-sui-wallet).

## Request test tokens through cURL[​](#request-test-tokens-through-curl "Direct link to Request test tokens through cURL")

Use the following cURL command to request tokens directly from the faucet server:

```

    
    
    curl --location --request POST 'https://faucet.devnet.sui.io/v1/gas' \--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \--data-raw '{  "FixedAmountRequest": {    "recipient": "<YOUR SUI ADDRESS>"  }}'
```

If you're working with a local network, replace `'https://faucet.devnet.sui.io/v1/gas'` with the appropriate value based on which package runs your network:

  * `sui-faucet`: `http://127.0.0.1:5003/gas`
  * `sui`: `http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas`

## Request test tokens through TypeScript SDK[​](#request-test-tokens-through-typescript-sdk "Direct link to Request test tokens through TypeScript SDK")

You can also access the faucet using the Sui TypeScript-SDK.

```

    
    
    import{ getFaucetHost, requestSuiFromFaucetV0 }from'@mysten/sui/faucet';// get tokens from the Devnet faucet serverawaitrequestSuiFromFaucetV0({// connect to Devnet	host:getFaucetHost('devnet'),	recipient:'<YOUR SUI ADDRESS>',});
```

## Test tokens on a local network[​](#test-tokens-on-a-local-network "Direct link to Test tokens on a local network")

If you are running a local Sui network, you can get tokens from your local faucet. See the [Connect to a Local Network](/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network#use-the-local-faucet) topic for details.

# graphql-rpc
# Querying Sui RPC with GraphQL

The quickest way to access the GraphQL service for Sui RPC is through the online IDE that provides a complete toolbox for fetching data and executing transactions on the network. The online IDE provides features such as auto-completion (use Ctrl+Space or just start typing), built-in documentation (Book icon, top-left), multi-tabs, and more.

The online IDE is available for [Mainnet](https://sui-mainnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) and [Testnet](https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql). This guide contains various queries that you can try directly in the IDE.

info

  * Any existing addresses/object IDs in these examples refer to `mainnet` data only.
  * Both [mainnet](https://sui-mainnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) and [testnet](https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) services are rate-limited to keep network throughput optimized.

For more details about some concepts used in the examples below, please see the [GraphQL concepts](/concepts/graphql-rpc) page, and consult the [reference](/references/sui-graphql) for full documentation on the supported schema.

## Discovering the schema[​](#discovering-the-schema "Direct link to Discovering the schema")

GraphQL introspection exposes the schema supported by the RPC service. The IDE's "Docs" pane (Book icon, top-left) and Search dialog (`Cmd`+`K` on macOS or `Ctrl`+`K` on Windows and Linux) offer a way to browse introspection output interactively.

The [official documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) provides an overview on introspection, and how to interact with it programmatically.

## Finding the reference gas price for latest epoch[​](#finding-the-reference-gas-price-for-latest-epoch "Direct link to Finding the reference gas price for latest epoch")

```

    
    
    query{epoch{referenceGasPrice}}
```

## Finding information about a specific historical epoch[​](#finding-information-about-a-specific-historical-epoch "Direct link to Finding information about a specific historical epoch")

This example finds the total stake rewards, the reference gas price, the number of checkpoints and the total gas fees for epoch 100. Note that in the query, the `id` argument is optional, and defaults to the latest epoch.

```

    
    
    query{epoch(id:100)# note that id is optional, and without it, latest epoch is returned{epochIdtotalStakeRewardsreferenceGasPricetotalCheckpointstotalGasFeestotalStakeSubsidiesstorageFund{totalObjectStorageRebatesnonRefundableBalance}}}
```

## Finding a transaction block by its digest[​](#finding-a-transaction-block-by-its-digest "Direct link to Finding a transaction block by its digest")

This example gets a transaction block by its digest and shows information such as the gas sponsor's address, the gas price, the gas budget, and effects from executing that transaction block.

```

    
    
    query{transactionBlock(digest:"FdKFgsQ9iRrxW6b1dh9WPGuNuaJWMXHJn1wqBQSqVqK2"){gasInput{gasSponsor{address}gasPricegasBudget}effects{statustimestampcheckpoint{sequenceNumber}epoch{epochIdreferenceGasPrice}}}}
```

## Finding the last ten transactions that are not a system transaction[​](#finding-the-last-ten-transactions-that-are-not-a-system-transaction "Direct link to Finding the last ten transactions that are not a system transaction")

```

    
    
    query{transactionBlocks(last:10,filter:{kind:PROGRAMMABLE_TX}){nodes{digestkind{__typename}}}}
```

## Finding all transactions that touched a given object[​](#finding-all-transactions-that-touched-a-given-object "Direct link to Finding all transactions that touched a given object")

This example finds all the transactions that touched (modified/transferred/deleted) a given object. This is useful for when we want to trace the flow of a Coin/StakeSui/NFT.

info

This example uses GraphQL [variables](/concepts/graphql-rpc#variables) and [pagination](/concepts/graphql-rpc#pagination). When using the online IDE, copy the variables JSON to the "Variables" window, below the main editor.

```

    
    
    query($objectID:SuiAddress!){transactionBlocks(filter:{changedObject:$objectID}){nodes{sender{address}digesteffects{objectChanges{nodes{address}}}}}}
```

**Variables** :

```

    
    
    {"objectID":"0x11c6ae8432156527fc2e12e05ac7db79f2e972510a823a4ef2e670f27ad7b52f"}
```

## Filtering transaction blocks by a function[​](#filtering-transaction-blocks-by-a-function "Direct link to Filtering transaction blocks by a function")

This example finds the last ten transaction blocks that called the `public_transfer` function, (as a move call transaction command).

info

This example makes usage of the filter `last`, which indicates that the user only wants the last ten transaction blocks known to the service.

```

    
    
    {transactionBlocks(last:10,filter:{function:"0x2::transfer::public_transfer"}){nodes{digest}}}
```

## Finding transaction balance changes[​](#finding-transaction-balance-changes "Direct link to Finding transaction balance changes")

This example finds the balance changes of all the transactions where a given address called a staking-related function. This is useful when you want to get your staking or unstaking history.

```

    
    
    query($address:SuiAddress!){transactionBlocks(filter:{function:"0x3::sui_system::request_add_stake"sentAddress:$address}){nodes{digesteffects{balanceChanges{nodes{owner{address}amount}}}}}}
```

**Variables** :

```

    
    
    {"address":"0xa9ad44383140a07cc9ea62d185c12c4d9ef9c6a8fd2f47e16316229815862d23"}
```

## Fetching a dynamic field on an object[​](#fetching-a-dynamic-field-on-an-object "Direct link to Fetching a dynamic field on an object")

info

This example uses aliases and [fragments](/concepts/graphql-rpc#fragments).

```

    
    
    queryDynamicField{object(address:"0xb57fba584a700a5bcb40991e1b2e6bf68b0f3896d767a0da92e69de73de226ac"){dynamicField(name:{type:"0x2::kiosk::Listing",bcs:"NLArx1UJguOUYmXgNG8Pv8KbKXLjWtCi6i0Yeq1VhfwA",}){...DynamicFieldSelect}}}fragmentDynamicFieldSelectonDynamicField{name{...MoveValueFields}value{...DynamicFieldValueSelection}}fragmentDynamicFieldValueSelectiononDynamicFieldValue{__typename...onMoveValue{...MoveValueFields}...onMoveObject{hasPublicTransfercontents{...MoveValueFields}}}fragmentMoveValueFieldsonMoveValue{type{repr}databcs}
```

## Fetching all dynamic fields on an object[​](#fetching-all-dynamic-fields-on-an-object "Direct link to Fetching all dynamic fields on an object")

This query can be used to paginate over the dynamic fields of an object. This works even when the object in question is [wrapped](/concepts/object-ownership/wrapped), by using the [owner](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/queries/owner) query, so can be used for iterating over the elements of on-chain data structures, like [Tables and Bags](/concepts/dynamic-fields/tables-bags).

info

This example uses [fragments](/concepts/graphql-rpc#fragments) and [variables](/concepts/graphql-rpc#variables).

```

    
    
    query($id:SuiAddress!){owner(address:$id){dynamicFields{nodes{name{...Value}value{__typename...onMoveValue{...Value}...onMoveObject{contents{...Value}}}}}}}fragmentValueonMoveValue{type{repr}json}
```

## Paginating checkpoints forward, five at a time[​](#page-forward "Direct link to Paginating checkpoints forward, five at a time")

```

    
    
    query($after:String){checkpoints(first:5,after:$after){pageInfo{hasNextPageendCursor}nodes{digesttimestamp}}}
```

Sets up a paginated query, starting at the genesis checkpoint, reading five checkpoints at a time, in increasing order of sequence number. The value of `pageInfo.hasNextPage` determines whether there is another page to be read, and the value of `pageInfo.endCursor` is fed back in as the cursor to read `$after`.

info

This example uses GraphQL [variables](/concepts/graphql-rpc#variables) and [pagination](/concepts/graphql-rpc#pagination).

## Paginating checkpoints backwards, five at a time[​](#page-back "Direct link to Paginating checkpoints backwards, five at a time")

```

    
    
    query($before:String){checkpoints(last:5,before:$before){pageInfo{hasPreviousPagestartCursor}nodes{digesttimestamp}}}
```

Sets up a paginated query, starting at the latest indexed checkpoint, reading five checkpoints at a time, in decreasing order of sequence number. The value of `pageInfo.hasPreviousPage` determines whether there is another page to be read, and the value of `pageInfo.startCursor` is fed back in as the cursor to read `$before`.

info

This example uses GraphQL [variables](/concepts/graphql-rpc#variables) and [pagination](/concepts/graphql-rpc#pagination).

## Executing a transaction[​](#executing-a-transaction "Direct link to Executing a transaction")

Transaction execution takes in two arguments, `txBytes` and `signatures`. `txBytes` is the serialized unsigned transaction data, which can be generated when using the Sui CLI's `client call` [command](/references/cli/client), to call a Move function by passing the `--serialize-unsigned-transaction` flag. The `signatures` can be generated using Sui CLI's [keytool](/references/cli/keytool) command `sui keytool sign`. More information on Sui CLI can be found [here](/references/cli).

```

    
    
    mutation($tx:String!,$sigs:[String!]!){executeTransactionBlock(txBytes:$tx,signatures:$sigs){errorseffects{statusepoch{startTimestamp}gasEffects{gasSummary{computationCost}}}}}
```

**Variables** :

```

# first-app
# Your First Sui dApp

Before you can create your first dApp, you must have [Sui installed](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install).

You use Move to write packages that live on chain, meaning they exist on the Sui network you publish them to. The instructions in this section walk you through writing a basic package, debugging and testing your code, and publishing. You need to follow these instructions in order to complete the exercise.

You use the `move` Sui CLI command for some instructions. The Sui CLI installs with the binaries, so you have it on your system if you follow the install instructions. To verify you have it installed, run the following command in a terminal or console.

```

    
    
    $ sui --version
```

If the console does not respond with a version number similar to the following, see the instructions to install Sui.

```

    
    
    $ sui 1.xx.x-abc123xyz
```

## Connecting to a network[​](#connecting-to-a-network "Direct link to Connecting to a network")

After installing Sui, you can connect to a network. Sui has three public networks (Devnet, Testnet, Mainnet), and you can also run and connect to a local Sui network. For each network, you need an on-chain address specific to that network. The address is an object with a unique ID in the form `0x8bd4613c004aac53d06bb7ceb7f46832c9ae69bdc105dfc5fcac225d2061fcac`. In addition to that address, you need SUI to pay for the gas fees associated with your on-chain activity, like publishing packages and making Move calls to those packages. For all networks besides Mainnet, you can get free SUI coins for your account to facilitate package development. For the purposes of this example, connect to the Testnet network.

### Connect to Testnet[​](#connect-to-testnet "Direct link to Connect to Testnet")

If you already have a network config set up, switch your active environment to Testnet. The following instruction is for the initial set up.

  1. In your terminal or console, use the following command to begin the configuration: 

```

    
        $ sui client
```

  2. At the prompt, type `y` and press `Enter` to connect to a Sui Full node server.
  3. At the following prompt, type the address of the Testnet server (`https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443`) and press `Enter`.
  4. At the following prompt, type `testnet` to give the network an alias and press `Enter`. You can use the alias in subsequent commands instead of typing the complete URL.
  5. At the following prompt, type `0` and press `Enter`. The selection creates an address in the `ed25519` signing scheme.
  6. The response provides an alias for your address, the actual address ID, and a secret recovery phrase. Be sure to save this information for later reference. Because this is on the Testnet network, the security of this information is not as important as if it were on Mainnet.
  7. In your terminal or console, use the following command to get SUI for your account. 

```

    
        $ sui client faucet
```

  8. You can confirm that you received SUI by using the following command. There may be a delay in receiving coins depending on the activity of the network. 

```

    
        $ sui client gas
```

You are now connected to the Sui Testnet network and should have an account with available SUI.

# sui-101
# Sui 101

In many education systems, 101-level classes are those that teach core competencies to build a foundation for the more advanced topics that are to come. The topics in this section provide the same experience for the Sui blockchain. They examine the core Sui development concepts that you use to build apps on Sui. As you start developing more advanced solutions, knowledge of these topics provides a good base for understanding the more advanced concepts you will employ.

## Working with PTBs[​](#working-with-ptbs "Direct link to Working with PTBs")

You can create programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) on Sui to perform multiple commands in a single transaction. The Working with PTBs topics demonstrate how to build efficient PTBs using the Sui TypeScript SDK.

Go to [Working with PTBs](/guides/developer/sui-101/working-with-ptbs).

## Using Events[​](#using-events "Direct link to Using Events")

You can emit events from your published packages on the Sui network. Using Events demonstrates how to emit events from your on-chain packages and monitor the activity of other objects emitting events.

Go to [Using Events](/guides/developer/sui-101/using-events).

## Shared versus Owned Objects[​](#shared-versus-owned-objects "Direct link to Shared versus Owned Objects")

Objects on Sui, unlike other blockchains, can be owned as well as shared. You can create transactions that leverage either type or both. Shared versus Owned Objects examines the differences and what considerations you should account for when deciding how to structure your on-chain app.

Go to [Shared versus Owned Objects](/guides/developer/sui-101/shared-owned).

## Access On-Chain Time[​](#access-on-chain-time "Direct link to Access On-Chain Time")

Sui provides a `Clock` module you can use to get network-based time. Access On-Chain Time examines the `Clock` module and the behavior of the available methods that affect transaction processing speed and the temporal exactness of the data you receive.

Go to [Access On-Chain Time](/guides/developer/sui-101/access-time).

# coin
# Create Coins and Tokens

Coins and tokens on Sui are similar. In practice, the terms are used interchangeably, but there are some differences in their implementation. You can learn about these differences in the respective standard documentation, [Closed-Loop Token](/standards/closed-loop-token) and [Coin](/standards/coin).

Publishing a coin on Sui is similar to publishing a new type. The main difference is the requirement of a one time witness when creating a coin.

[examples/move/coin/sources/my_coin.move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/move/coin/sources/my_coin.move)

```

    
    
    module examples::my_coin {usesui::coin::{Self, TreasuryCap};publicstruct MY_COINhasdrop {}funinit(witness: MY_COIN, ctx: &mut TxContext) {let (treasury, metadata) = coin::create_currency(witness, 6, b"MY_COIN", b"", b"", option::none(), ctx);				transfer::public_freeze_object(metadata);				transfer::public_transfer(treasury, ctx.sender())		}publicfunmint(treasury_cap: &mut TreasuryCap<MY_COIN>, amount: u64, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext,		) {letcoin = coin::mint(treasury_cap, amount, ctx);				transfer::public_transfer(coin, recipient)		}}
```

The `Coin<T>` is a generic implementation of a coin on Sui. Access to the `TreasuryCap` provides control over the minting and burning of coins. Further transactions can be sent directly to the `sui::coin::Coin` with `TreasuryCap` object as authorization.

The example module includes a `mint` function. You pass the `TreasuryCap` created from the `init` function to the module's `mint` function. The function then uses the `mint` function from the `Coin` module to create (mint) a coin and then transfer it to an address.

[examples/move/coin/sources/my_coin.move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/move/coin/sources/my_coin.move)

```

    
    
    publicfunmint(treasury_cap: &mut TreasuryCap<MY_COIN>, amount: u64, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext,) {letcoin = coin::mint(treasury_cap, amount, ctx);  transfer::public_transfer(coin, recipient)}
```

### Sui CLI[​](#sui-cli "Direct link to Sui CLI")

If you published the previous example to a Sui network, you can use the `sui client call` command to mint coins and deliver them to the address you provide. See [Sui CLI](/references/cli) for more information on the command line interface.

tip

Beginning with the Sui `v1.24.1` [release](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/mainnet-v1.24.1), the `--gas-budget` flag is no longer required for CLI commands.

```

    
    
    sui client call --function mint --module mycoin --package <PACKAGE-ID> --args <TREASURY-CAP-ID> <COIN-AMOUNT> <RECIPIENT-ADDRESS> --gas-budget <GAS-AMOUNT>
```

If the call is successful your console displays the result, which includes a **Balance Changes** section with the following information included:

```

    
    
    ...Owner: Account Address ( <RECIPIENT-ADDRESS> ) CoinType: <PACKAGE-ID>::mycoin::MYCOIN Amount: <COIN-AMOUNT>...
```

## DenyList[​](#denylist "Direct link to DenyList")

The Sui framework provides a `DenyList` singleton, shared object that the bearer of a `DenyCap` can access to specify a list of addresses that are unable to use a Sui core type. The initial use case for `DenyList`, however, focuses on limiting access to coins of a specified type. This is useful, for example, when creating a regulated coin on Sui that requires the ability to block certain addresses from using it as inputs to transactions. Regulated coins on Sui satisfy any regulations that require the ability to prevent known bad actors from having access to those coins.

info

The `DenyList` object is a system object that has the address `0x403`. You cannot create it yourself.

## Create regulated coin[​](#create-regulated-coin "Direct link to Create regulated coin")

If you need the ability to deny specific addresses from having access to your coin, you can use the `create_regulated_currency` function (instead of `create_currency`) to create it.

Behind the scenes, `create_regulated_currency` uses the `create_currency` function to create the coin, but also produces a `DenyCap` object that allows its bearer to control access to the coin's deny list in a `DenyList` object. Consequently, the way to create a coin using `create_regulated_currency` is similar to the previous example, with the addition of a transfer of the `DenyCap` object to the module publisher.

## Create tokens[​](#create-tokens "Direct link to Create tokens")

Tokens reuse the `TreasuryCap` defined in the `sui::coin` module and therefore have the same initialization process. The `coin::create_currency` function guarantees the uniqueness of the `TreasuryCap` and forces the creation of a `CoinMetadata` object.

Coin-like functions perform the minting and burning of tokens. Both require the `TreasuryCap`:

  * `token::mint` - mint a token
  * `token::burn` - burn a token

See [Closed-Loop Token](/standards/closed-loop-token) standard for complete details of working with tokens.

# stablecoins
# Stablecoins on Sui

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that are designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency or a basket of assets. They are widely used for trading, lending, and as a store of value.

## Available stablecoins[​](#available-stablecoins "Direct link to Available stablecoins")

On Sui, you can interact with various stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, Agora, and Ondo USDY.

### USDC (USD Coin)[​](#usdc-usd-coin "Direct link to USDC \(USD Coin\)")

USDC is a fully collateralized US dollar stablecoin issued by regulated financial institutions. Each USDC token is backed by one US dollar held in reserve. USDC is widely used for trading, payments, and as a stable store of value.

For more detailed information on how to interact with USDC on Sui, refer to the [USDC guide](#usdc-guide).

**Site:** [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)

### USDT (Tether)[​](#usdt-tether "Direct link to USDT \(Tether\)")

USDT, also known as Tether, is one of the oldest and most widely used stablecoins. It is pegged to the US dollar and is backed by a mix of reserves, including cash, cash equivalents, and other assets.

USDT is currently not issued natively on Sui. For more information on bridging USDT to Sui, refer to [SUI Bridging](/concepts/tokenomics/sui-bridging).

**Site:** [Tether](https://tether.to/)

### Agora[​](#agora "Direct link to Agora")

AUSD is a fully collateralized US dollar stablecoin issued by Agora Finance.

**Site:** [Agora Finance](https://www.agora.finance/)

### Ondo USDY[​](#ondo-usdy "Direct link to Ondo USDY")

USDY is a fully collateralized US dollar stablecoin issued by Ondo Finance, allowing users to earn yield from US Treasury Bills.

**Site:** [Ondo Finance](https://ondo.finance/)

## How to transfer USDC on Sui[​](#usdc-guide "Direct link to How to transfer USDC on Sui")

USDC provides the ability to transfer dollars over public blockchains using smart contracts. The smart contract allows users to send, receive, and store dollars on chain with a wallet.

Here's a quickstart guide for developers to build an app to perform their first USDC transfer on Sui.

### Contract addresses[​](#contract-addresses "Direct link to Contract addresses")

```

    
        0xa1ec7fc00a6f40db9693ad1415d0c193ad3906494428cf252621037bd7117e29::usdc::USDC
```

```

    
        0xdba34672e30cb065b1f93e3ab55318768fd6fef66c15942c9f7cb846e2f900e7::usdc::USDC
```

### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before you start building the sample app to perform a USDC transfer, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org). npm comes with Node.js.
  * [Sui Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil): Install the Sui Wallet browser extension, set up your wallet, and connect it to the appropriate network. Ensure that your wallet is funded with: 
    * Some SUI tokens to cover transaction fees. (**Request Testnet SUI Tokens** from the **Wallet Settings** page)
    * USDC tokens for the transfer. ([USDC Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/))

### Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

To begin, create a new project directory (`usdc-transfer-app`, for example) and initialize it with pnpm:

```

    
    
    pnpm init
```

To keep a small footprint, the instruction uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to render the example React-based app. You can use a more robust framework, like Next.js, or a different package manager, but you must modify the steps appropriately.

```

    
    
    pnpm add react react-dom parcel
```

Install Sui dependencies next:

```

    
    
    pnpm add @mysten/dapp-kit @mysten/sui @tanstack/react-query
```

Finally, update your `package.json` to include the following script:

```

    
    
    "scripts":{"start":"parcel index.html"},
```

### Create site structure[​](#create-site-structure "Direct link to Create site structure")

At the root of your project directory, create an `index.html` file and save the following content to it:

Click to open

`index.html` file

[examples/usdc-transfer-app/index.html](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/usdc-transfer-app/index.html)

```

    
    
    <!DOCTYPEhtml><htmllang="en"><head><metacharset="UTF-8"/><metaname="viewport"content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/><title>Sui USDC Sender</title><linkhref="./global.css"rel="stylesheet"><linkrel="icon"href="./favicon.ico"type="image/x-icon"/></head><body><divid="root"></div><scriptsrc="index.js"type="module"></script></body></html>
```

Next, create and save an `index.js` file in the same location with the following code:

Click to open

`index.js` file

[examples/usdc-transfer-app/index.js](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/usdc-transfer-app/index.js)

```

    
    
    importReactfrom'react';importReactDOMfrom'react-dom';import{ createRoot }from'react-dom/client';importAppfrom'./App.js';const root =createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));root.render(<App tab="home"/>);
```

To style the output for the site, create a `global.css` file in the root of your project. Copy and paste the following minimal styling into the file and save:

Click to open

`global.css` file

[examples/usdc-transfer-app/global.css](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/usdc-transfer-app/global.css)

```

    
    
    .mainwrapper{display: flex;flex-direction: column;min-height:100vh;padding:6rem;}.outerwrapper{z-index:10;width:100%;max-width:64rem;margin:0 auto;justify-content: center;justify-content: space-between;font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas,"Liberation Mono","Courier New", monospace;font-size:0.875rem;line-height:1.25rem;}.h1{font-size:2.25rem;line-height:2.5rem;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom:2rem;}.status{margin-top:1rem}.form{margin-top:2rem}.input{padding:0.5rem;border-width:1px;border-radius:0.25rem;margin-right:0.5rem;color:black;}.connected{background-color:rgb(191219254);color:black;}.connected:hover{background-color:rgb(147197253);}.notconnected{background-color:rgb(209213219);color:rgb(107114128);}.transition{padding:0.5rem;border-radius:0.25rem;transition-property: color, background-color, border-color, text-decoration-color, fill, stroke;transition-timing-function:cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1);transition-duration:150ms;transition-duration:200ms;}
```

Finally, create an `App.js` file at the project root. When complete, this file will hold the logic for the USDC transfer. For now, just create the file to display some basic text. This example does not use TypeScript to keep the instruction focused, but you can certainly use it in your own projects.

Click to open

`App.js` file

```

    
    
    importReactfrom'react';functionApp(){return(<div><h1>Hello,World!</h1><p>This is a minimal React app.</p></div>);}exportdefaultApp;
```

Start the development server to make sure the default app runs using the following command in the root of your project:

```

    
    
    pnpm start
```

Open a browser to `localhost:1234` to make sure the Hello World text appears.

### Import code and setup[​](#import-code-and-setup "Direct link to Import code and setup")

Open the `App.js` file and make the changes that follow.

First, import necessary libraries and set up the network configuration.

# nft
# Create a Non-Fungible Token

On Sui, everything is an object. Moreover, everything is a non-fungible token (NFT) as its objects are unique, non-fungible, and owned.

Creating NFTs on Sui differs from other blockchains that are not object based. Those blockchains require a dedicated standard to handle the properties that define NFTs because they are based on a mapping between smart contracts and the token's ID. For instance, the ERC-721 standard on Ethereum was necessary to pair a globally unique ID with the relevant smart contract address to create a unique token instance on the network.

On Sui, every object already has a unique ID, so whether you're dealing with a million fungible tokens, like coins, or thousands of NFTs with individual characteristics, like SuiFrens, your smart contracts on Sui always interact with individual objects.

Imagine you create an Excitable Chimp NFT collection on Sui and another blockchain that isn't object based. To get an attribute like the Chimp's name on the other blockchain, you would need to interact with the smart contract that created the NFT to get that information (typically from off-chain storage) using the NFT ID. On Sui, the name attribute can be a field on the object that defines the NFT itself. This construct provides a much more straightforward process for accessing metadata for the NFT as the smart contract that wants the information can just return the name from the object itself.

## Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

The following example creates a basic NFT on Sui. The `TestnetNFT` struct defines the NFT with an `id`, `name`, `description`, and `url` fields.

[examples/move/nft/sources/testnet_nft.move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/move/nft/sources/testnet_nft.move)

```

    
    
    publicstruct TestnetNFThaskey, store {id: UID,name: string::String,description: string::String,url: Url,}
```

In this example, anyone can mint the NFT by calling the `mint_to_sender` function. As the name suggests, the function creates a new `TestnetNFT` and transfers it to the address that makes the call.

[examples/move/nft/sources/testnet_nft.move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/move/nft/sources/testnet_nft.move)

```

    
    
    #[allow(lint(self_transfer))]publicfunmint_to_sender(name: vector<u8>,description: vector<u8>,url: vector<u8>,ctx: &mut TxContext) {letsender = ctx.sender();letnft = TestnetNFT {id: object::new(ctx),name: string::utf8(name),description: string::utf8(description),url: url::new_unsafe_from_bytes(url)  };  event::emit(NFTMinted {object_id: object::id(&nft),creator: sender,name: nft.name,  });  transfer::public_transfer(nft, sender);}
```

The module includes functions to return NFT metadata, too. Referencing the hypothetical used previously, you can call the `name` function to get that value. As you can see, the function simply returns the name field value of the NFT itself.

[examples/move/nft/sources/testnet_nft.move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/move/nft/sources/testnet_nft.move)

# cryptography
# Cryptography

Effective use of cryptography keeps your smart contract transactions secure on the Sui blockchain.

## Signature verification[​](#signature-verification "Direct link to Signature verification")

Move contracts in Sui support verifications for several on-chain signature schemes. Not all signatures supported in on-chain verification are supported as user signature verification. See [Signatures](/concepts/cryptography/transaction-auth/signatures) for valid signature schemes for transaction authorization.

Go to [Sui On-Chain Signatures Verification in Move](/guides/developer/cryptography/signing).

## Groth16[​](#groth16 "Direct link to Groth16")

A zero-knowledge proof is a method by which a party, known as the prover, can confirm the truthfulness of a claim without disclosing any information about the underlying data. For instance, it's possible for the prover to demonstrate they have solved a sudoku puzzle without showing the actual solution. Groth16 is one such proof you can use in your smart contracts.

Go to [Groth16](/guides/developer/cryptography/groth16).

## Hashing[​](#hashing "Direct link to Hashing")

A cryptographic hash function is a widely used cryptographic primitive that maps an arbitrary length input to a fixed length output, the hash value. The hash function is designed to be a one-way function, which means that it is infeasible to invert the function to find the input data from a given hash value, and to be collision resistant, which means that it is infeasible to find two different inputs that map to the same hash value. Use available hashing functions to provide security to your smart contracts.

Go to [Hashing](/guides/developer/cryptography/hashing).

## Elliptic Curve Verifiable Random Function (ECVRF)[​](#elliptic-curve-verifiable-random-function-ecvrf "Direct link to Elliptic Curve Verifiable Random Function \(ECVRF\)")

Use ECVRFs to generate a random number and provide proof that the number used a secret key for generation. The public key corresponding to the secret key verifies the proof, so you can use it as a random number generator that generates outputs that anyone can verify. Applications that need verifiable randomness on chain can also benefit from its use.

Go to [ECVRF](/guides/developer/cryptography/ecvrf).

## Multisig[​](#multisig "Direct link to Multisig")

Sui allows you to mix and match key schemes in a single multisig account. For example, you can pick a single Ed25519 mnemonic-based key and two ECDSA secp256r1 keys to create a multisig account that always requires the Ed25519 key, but also one of the ECDSA secp256r1 keys to sign. You could use this structure for mobile secure enclave stored keys as two-factor authentication.

Go to [Multisig](/guides/developer/cryptography/multisig).

# advanced
# Advanced Topics

Information in the Advanced Topics section covers coding practices, useful features, and other developer-focused considerations that might arise as you continue your development journey on Sui. The topics in this section aren't necessarily more difficult than other topics, but they include subjects you might not encounter or need to consider until you're developing more advanced solutions on the Sui network.

## Custom Indexer[​](#custom-indexer "Direct link to Custom Indexer")

You can build custom indexers using the Sui micro-data ingestion framework. To create an indexer, you subscribe to a checkpoint stream with full checkpoint content. Establishing a custom indexer helps improve latency, allows pruning the data of your Sui Full node, and provides efficient assemblage of checkpoint data.

Go to [Custom Indexer](/guides/developer/advanced/custom-indexer).

## Migrating to GraphQL[​](#migrating-to-graphql "Direct link to Migrating to GraphQL")

See the Migrating to GraphQL guide to upgrade your smart contracts to use the GraphQL API.

This guide compares JSON-RPC queries to their equivalent GraphQL counterpart. While it is possible to systematically rewrite JSON-RPC queries (for example, `sui_getTotalTransactionBlocks`) to their GraphQL counterparts using this guide, it is recommended that you revisit your application's query patterns to take full advantage of the flexibility that GraphQL offers in serving queries that touch multiple potentially nested endpoints (for example transactions, balances, coins), and use the following examples to get a flavor of how the two APIs express similar concepts.

# app-examples
# App Examples

The ever-growing number of examples in this section showcase packages for the Sui blockchain. Extract techniques used in these examples to apply to your own Sui projects as they are written by Sui and Move experts.

caution

Use dedicated nodes/shared services rather than public endpoints for production apps. The public endpoints maintained by Mysten Labs (`fullnode.<NETWORK>.sui.io:443`) are rate-limited, and support only 100 requests per 30 seconds. Do not use public endpoints in production applications with high traffic volume.

You can either run your own Full nodes, or outsource this to a professional infrastructure provider (preferred for apps that have high traffic). You can find a list of reliable RPC endpoint providers for Sui on the [Sui Dev Portal](https://sui.io/developers#dev-tools) using the **Node Service** tag.

# dev-cheat-sheet
# Sui Developer Cheat Sheet

Quick reference on best practices for Sui Network developers.

## Move[​](#move "Direct link to Move")

### General[​](#general "Direct link to General")

  * Read about package upgrades and write upgrade-friendly code: 
    * Packages are immutable, so buggy package code can be called forever. Add protections at the object level instead.
    * If you upgrade a package `P` to `P'`, other packages and clients that depend on `P` will continue using `P`, not auto-update to `P'`. Both dependent packages and client code must be explicitly updated to point at `P'`.
    * Packages that expect to be extended by dependent packages can avoid breaking their extensions with each upgrade by providing a standard (unchanging) interface that all versions conform to. See this example for [message sending](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/74dea3bf22f0e27628b432c3e9eac05c85786a99/sui/wormhole/sources/publish_message.move) across a bridge from Wormhole. Extension packages that produce messages to send can use [`prepare_message`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/74dea3bf22f0e27628b432c3e9eac05c85786a99/sui/wormhole/sources/publish_message.move#L68-L90) from any version of the Wormhole package to produce a [`MessageTicket`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/74dea3bf22f0e27628b432c3e9eac05c85786a99/sui/wormhole/sources/publish_message.move#L52-L66) while client code to send the message must pass that `MessageTicket` into [`publish_message`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/74dea3bf22f0e27628b432c3e9eac05c85786a99/sui/wormhole/sources/publish_message.move#L92-L152) in the latest version of the package.
    * `public` function signatures cannot be deleted or changed, but `public(friend)` functions can. Use `public(friend)` or private visibility liberally unless you are exposing library functions that will live forever.
    * It is not possible to delete `struct` types, add new fields (though you can add dynamic fields), or add new [abilities](https://move-language.github.io/move/abilities.html) via an upgrade. Introduce new types carefully—they will live forever!
  * Use `vector`-backed collections (`vector`, `VecSet`, `VecMap`, `PriorityQueue`) with a **known** maximum size of ≤ 1000 items. 
    * Use dynamic field-backed collections (`Table`, `Bag`, `ObjectBag`, `ObjectTable`, `LinkedTable`) for any collection that allows third-party addition, larger collections, and collections of unknown size.
    * Move objects have a maximum size of 250KB—any attempt to create a larger object leads to an aborted transaction. Ensure that your objects do not have an ever-growing `vector`-backed collection.
  * If your function `f` needs a payment in (e.g.) SUI from the caller, use `fun f(payment: Coin<SUI>)` not `fun f(payment: &mut Coin<SUI>, amount: u64)`. This is safer for callers—they know exactly how much they are paying, and do not need to trust `f` to extract the right amount.
  * Don't micro-optimize gas usage. Sui computation costs are rounded up to the closest _bucket_ , so only very drastic changes will make a difference. In particular, if your transaction is already in the lowest cost bucket, it can't get any cheaper.
  * Follow the [Move coding conventions](https://move-language.github.io/move/coding-conventions.html) for consistent style.

### Composability[​](#composability "Direct link to Composability")

  * Use the `display` standard to customize how your objects show up in wallets, apps, and explorers
  * Avoid “self-transfers”—whenever possible, instead of writing `transfer::transfer(obj, tx_context::sender(ctx))`, return `obj` from the current function. This allows a caller or programmable transaction block to use `obj`.

### Testing[​](#testing "Direct link to Testing")

  * Use [`sui::test_scenario`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/test/test_scenario.move) to mimic multi-transaction, multi-sender test scenarios.
  * Use the [`sui::test_utils`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/test/test_utils.move#L5) module for better test error messages via `assert_eq`, debug printing via `print`, and test-only destruction via `destroy`.
  * Use `sui move test --coverage` to compute code coverage information for your tests, and `sui move coverage source --module <name>` to see uncovered lines highlighted in red. Push coverage all the way to 100% if feasible.

## Apps[​](#apps "Direct link to Apps")

  * For optimal performance and data consistency, apps should submit writes and reads for the same full node. In the TS SDK, this means that apps should use the wallet's [`signTransactionBlock`](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit) API, then submit the transaction via a call to [`execute_transactionBlock`](/sui-api-ref#sui_executetransactionblock) on the app's full node, _not_ use the wallet's `signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` API. This ensures read-after-write-consistency--reads from the app's full node will reflect writes from the transaction right away instead of waiting for a checkpoint.
  * For lower latency, use [`executeTransactionBlock`](/sui-api-ref#sui_executetransactionblock) with `"showEffects": false` and `"showEvents": false` if your app needs to know that a transaction was confirmed, but does not immediately need to see the transaction effects or read the objects/events written by the transaction.
  * Apps should implement a local cache for frequently read data rather than over-fetching from the full node.
  * Whenever possible, use programmable transaction blocks to compose existing on-chain functionality rather than publishing new smart contract code. Programmable transaction blocks allow large-scale batching and heterogeneous composition, driving already-low gas fees down even further.
  * Apps should leave gas budget, gas price, and coin selection to the wallet. This gives wallets more flexibility, and it's the wallet's responsibility to dry run a transaction to ensure it doesn't fail.

## Signing[​](#signing "Direct link to Signing")

  * **Never** sign two concurrent transactions that are touching the same owned object. Either use independent owned objects, or wait for one transaction to conclude before sending the next one. Violating this rule might lead to client [equivocation](/sui-glossary#equivocation), which locks up the owned objects involved in the two transactions until the end of the current epoch.
  * Any `sui client` command that crafts a transaction (e.g., `sui client publish`, `sui client call`) can accept the `--serialize-output` flag to output a base64 transaction to be signed.
  * Sui supports several signature schemes for transaction signing, including native multisig.

## zkLogin[​](#zklogin "Direct link to zkLogin")

  * Call the proving service as sparingly as possible. Design your app flows such that you call the proving service only when the user is about to perform a real transaction.
  * Beware of how you cache the ephemeral private key. Treat the private key akin to a piece of highly sensitive data, e.g., password. If an (unexpired) ephemeral private key and its corresponding ZK proof are leaked, then an attacker can steal user's assets.

# move-2024-migration
# Migrating to Move 2024

New features for Move are becoming available in 2024, a part of the aptly titled "Move 2024" edition. Many of these changes are enhancements to the source language, affecting the compiler without requiring any changes to the binary representation published on chain.

The primary goal of these changes is to make Move easier to write, and hopefully easier to read. The relatively few breaking changes introduced to the source language are to better position Move to handle future advancements.

Existing code will continue to compile, even with the addition of these new features. And because these features are opt-in, you can write your packages with the new features, even if your dependencies do not. Opting to take advantage of the new features in your current modules, however, does introduce some breaking changes.

This document highlights some new features to try out and shows how to migrate your existing modules to use Move 2024.

info

Please, provide any feedback or report any issues you encounter via [GitHub](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/issues/new/choose), [Discord](https://discord.gg/Sui), or [Telegram](https://t.me/SuiTokenNetwork).

## How to migrate[​](#how-to-migrate "Direct link to How to migrate")

To migrate a project to Move 2024 Beta:

  1. Delete your existing `Move.lock` file (if one exists) to make sure you're using the newest `sui-framework` version.
  2. Perform one of the following: 
     * Run `sui move migrate` in the root of your Move project. See [Automatic migration](#automatic-migration).
     * Alternatively, update your `Move.toml` file's `[package]` entry to include `edition = "2024.beta"`. If you do this, you might receive a number of new errors related to the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes).

### Automatic migration[​](#automatic-migration "Direct link to Automatic migration")

Move 2024 includes an automatic migration script that you can use by calling `sui move migrate` in the root of your Move project. Upon running, your console prompts you for which Move edition to use. If you select `2024.beta`, the script invokes the compiler and attempts to automatically update your code to avoid the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) the update introduces (including marking structs as `public`, mutable variables with the `mut` keyword, avoiding restricted keywords, swapping `friend`s for `public(package)`, and even updating paths to global paths in many cases).

After this is done, your console displays a diff of the changes the script intends to make. If you accept the changes, the script updates your code and your `Move.toml` file automatically. You are now using Move 2024 Beta.

### Update IDE support[​](#update-ide-support "Direct link to Update IDE support")

Use the new [VSCode Move extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mysten.move) to get support for Move 2024 features. The new extension has a number of improvements over the original [move-analyzer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=move.move-analyzer), but if you would like to keep using the original one, be sure to rebuild and reinstall the `move-analyzer` binary to get 2024 support:

```

    
    
    cargo install --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git move-analyzer
```

See the getting started guide on [Move IDEs and plugins](/references/contribute/sui-environment#move-ides-and-plugins) for more information.

## New features[​](#new-features "Direct link to New features")

Here is a brief overview of some of the new features in Move 2024.

### Method syntax[​](#method-syntax "Direct link to Method syntax")

You can call certain functions now as methods using the `.` syntax. For example, the following call

```

    
    
    vector::push_back(&mut v, coin::value(&c));
```

can now be written as

```

    
    
    v.push_back(c.value());
```

Where the receiver of the method (`v` and `c` in this example) is automatically borrowed if necessary (as `&mut v` and `&c` respectively).

You can call any function defined in the same module as the receiver's type as a method if it takes the receiver as its first argument.

For functions defined outside the module, you can declare methods using `public use fun` and `use fun`.

### Index syntax[​](#index-syntax "Direct link to Index syntax")

With method syntax, you can annotate certain functions as being `#[syntax(index)]` methods. You then call these methods using `v[i]`-style calls.

For example,

```

    
    
    *&mut v[i] = v[j];
```

resolves to

```

    
    
    *vector::borrow_mut(&mut v, i) = *vector::borrow(&v, j);
```

### public(package)[​](#public-package "Direct link to public\(package\)")

`friend` declarations, and the associated `public(friend)` visibility modifiers, are deprecated. In their place is the `public(package)` visibility modifier, which allows calling functions only within the same package where they are defined.

### Positional fields[​](#positional-fields "Direct link to Positional fields")

You can now define `struct`s with positional fields, which are accessed by zero-based index. For example,

```

    
    
    publicstruct Pair(u64, u64) hascopy, drop, store;
```

then to access each field,

```

    
    
    publicfunsum(p: &Pair): u64 { p.0 + p.1}
```

And as this example shows, you can now declare abilities after the struct field list.

### Nested `use` and standard library defaults[​](#nested-use-and-standard-library-defaults "Direct link to nested-use-and-standard-library-defaults")

You can now nest `use` aliases for more conciseness.

```

    
    
    usesui::{balance, coin::{Self, Coin}};
```

Additionally, the following `use` declarations are now automatically included in every module:

```

    
    
    usestd::vector;usestd::option::{Self, Option};usesui::object::{Self, ID, UID};usesui::transfer;usesui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};
```

### Automatic referencing in equality[​](#automatic-referencing-in-equality "Direct link to Automatic referencing in equality")

Equality operations, `==` and `!=`, now automatically borrow if one side is a reference and the other is not. For example,

```

    
    
    funcheck(x: u64, r: &u64): bool { x == r}
```

is equivalent to

```

    
    
    funcheck(x: u64, r: &u64): bool { &x == r}
```

This automatic borrowing can occur on either side of `==` and `!=`.

### Loop labels[​](#loop-labels "Direct link to Loop labels")

When nesting loops, it can be convenient to break to the outer loop. For example,

```

    
    
    letmuti = 0;letmutj = 0;letmutterminate_loop = false;while (i < 10) {while (j < 10) {if (haystack(i, j) == needle) {      terminate_loop = true;break;    };    j = j + 1;  };if (terminate_loop) break;  i = i + 1;}
```

Now, you can directly name the outer loop (`outer` in this case) and break it all at once:

```

    
    
    letmuti = 0;letmutj = 0;'outer:while (i < 10) {while (j < 10) {if (haystack(i, j) == needle) break'outer;    j = j + 1;  };  i = i + 1;}
```

### `break` with value[​](#break-with-value "Direct link to break-with-value")

It's now possible to `break` with a value from a `loop`. For example,

```

    
    
    letmuti = 0;letx: u64 = loop {if (v[i] > 10) break i;  i = i + 1;};
```

You can achieve this with labels, as well. For example,

```

    
    
    letmuti = 0;letmutj = 0;letitem = 'outer: loop {while (j < 10) {letitem = haystack(i, j);if (item == needle) break'outer option::some(item);    j = j + 1;  };  i = i + 1;if (i == 10) break option::none();};
```

## Breaking changes[​](#breaking-changes "Direct link to Breaking changes")

Breaking changes are, unfortunately, a growing pain in Move 2024. We anticipate these changes to be minimally invasive and have provided a migration script to automate them in most cases. In addition, these changes pave the way for new features still to come in Move 2024.

### Datatype visibility requirements[​](#datatype-visibility-requirements "Direct link to Datatype visibility requirements")

Currently, all structs in Move are, by convention, public: any other module or package can import them and refer to them by type. To make this clearer, Move 2024 requires that all structs be declared with the `public` keyword. For example,

```

    
    
    // legacy codestruct S {x: u64 }// Move 2024 codepublicstruct S {x: u64 }
```

Any non-public struct produces an error at this time, though the Move team is working on new visibility options for future releases.

### Mutability requirements[​](#mutability-requirements "Direct link to Mutability requirements")

Previously, all variables in Move were implicitly mutable. For example,

```

    
    
    funf(s: S, y: u64): u64 {leta = 0;let S { x } = s;  a = 1;  x = 10;  y = 5;  x + y}
```

Now, you must declare mutable variables explicitly:

```

    
    
    funf(s: S, muty: u64): u64 {letmuta = 0;let S { mut x } = 5;  a = 1;  x = 10;  y = 5;  x + y}
```

The compiler now produces an error if you attempt to reassign or borrow a variable mutably without this explicit declaration.

### Removing friends and `public(friend)`[​](#removing-friends-and-publicfriend "Direct link to removing-friends-and-publicfriend")

Friends and the `public(friend)` visibilities were introduced early in Move's development, predating even the package system. As indicated in the [public(package)](#public-package) section, `public(package)` deprecates `public(friend)` in Move 2024.

The following declaration now produces an error:

```

    
    
    module pkg::m {friendpkg::a;public(friend) funf() { ... }}module pkg::a {funcalls_f() { ... pkg::m::f() ... }}
```

Instead, if you want your function to be visible only in the package, write:

```

    
    
    module pkg::m {public(package) funf() { ... }}module pkg::a {// this now works directlyfuncalls_f() { ... pkg::m::f() ... }}
```

### New keywords[​](#new-keywords "Direct link to New keywords")

Looking toward the future, Move 2024 Beta adds the following keywords to the language: `enum`, `for`, `match`, `mut`, and `type`. The compiler, unfortunately, now produces parsing errors when it finds these in other positions. This is a necessary change as the language matures. If you perform automatic migration, the migration tool renames these as `enum` and so on, rewriting the code to use these escaped forms.

### Revised paths and namespaces[​](#revised-paths-and-namespaces "Direct link to Revised paths and namespaces")

Move 2024 revises how paths and namespaces work compared to legacy Move, toward easing `enum` aliasing in the future. Consider the following snippet from a test annotation in the `sui_system` library:

```

    
    
    usesui_system::sui_system;...#[expected_failure(abort_code = sui_system::validator_set::EInvalidCap)]
```

Legacy Move would always treat a three-part name as an address(`sui_system`), module(`validator_set`), and module member (`EInvalidCap`). Move 2024 respects scope for `use`, so `sui_system` in the attribute resolves to the module, producing a name resolution error overall.

To avoid cases where this is the intended behavior, Move 2024 introduces a prefix operation for global qualification. To use, you can rewrite this annotation as:

```

    
    
    usesui_system::sui_system;...#[expected_failure(abort_code = ::sui_system::validator_set::EInvalidCap)]// ^ note `::` here
```

The migration script attempts to remediate naming errors using global qualification when possible.

## Follow along[​](#follow-along "Direct link to Follow along")

The beta release of Move 2024 comes with some powerful new features in addition to the breaking changes described here. There are also more on the horizon. Join the [Sui developer newsletter](https://sui.io/developers#newsletter) to learn about new, exciting features coming to Move this year, including syntactic macros, enums with pattern matching, and other user-defined syntax extensions.

### `alpha` and `beta` guidance[​](#alpha-and-beta-guidance "Direct link to alpha-and-beta-guidance")

  * `beta` (specified via `edition = "2024.beta"`) is the recommended edition. It includes all the new features mentioned above and all breaking changes. While there is the risk of breaking changes or bugs in `beta`, you should feel comfortable using it in your projects. As new features are added and tested, they will be included in the `beta` edition. The `beta` edition will end after _all_ features for the year have been added and finalized.
  * `alpha` (specified via `edition = "2024.alpha"`) will get new features and changes as they are developed. Breaking changes to features in `alpha` should be expected. As such, take caution when using`alpha` in your projects.

To run a Sui validator, you must set up and configure a Sui Validator node. After you have a running node, you must have a minimum of 30 million SUI in your staking pool to join the validator set on the Sui network.

To learn how to set up and configure a Sui Validator node, see [Sui for Node Operators](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/nre/sui_for_node_operators.md) on GitHub. The guide includes all of the information you need to configure your Validator node. It also provides guidance on the tasks you must perform after you join the validator set.

Specific steps you must take include:

  * Install and configure Sui
  * Configure Port and Protocol settings
  * Key management
  * Storage configuration
  * Software updates
  * On-chain commands
  * Update the Gas Price Survey
  * Reporting other validators

### Validator staking pool requirements[​](#validator-staking-pool-requirements "Direct link to Validator staking pool requirements")

There are minimum staking requirements a validator must satisfy to become active and to stay in the active validator set.

More precisely:

  * A validator candidate must accrue at least 30M SUI of stake before they can request to join the validator set.
  * If an active validator’s stake falls below 20M SUI, they have seven epochs of grace period to gain back the stake before being removed from the validator set.
  * If an active validator’s stake falls below 15M SUI, they are removed from the validator set at the end of the current epoch boundary. Sui uses 24-hour epochs.

## Hardware requirements to run a Validator node[​](#hardware-requirements-to-run-a-validator-node "Direct link to Hardware requirements to run a Validator node")

Suggested minimum hardware specifications to run a Sui Validator node:

  * CPU: 24 physical cores (or 48 virtual cores)
  * Memory: 128 GB
  * Storage: 4 TB NVME
  * Network: 1 Gbps

## Validator consensus and voting power[​](#validator-consensus-and-voting-power "Direct link to Validator consensus and voting power")

The total voting power on Sui is always 10,000, regardless of the amount staked. Therefore, the quorum threshold is 6,667. There is no limit to the amount of SUI users can stake with a validator. Each validator has consensus voting power proportional to SUI in its staking pool, with one exception: the voting power of an individual validator is capped at 1,000 (10% of the total). If a validator accumulates more than 10% of total stake, the validator's voting power remains fixed at 10%, and the remaining voting power is spread across the rest of the validator set.

### User staking and withdrawals[​](#user-staking-and-withdrawals "Direct link to User staking and withdrawals")

When users stake SUI tokens, these SUI objects are wrapped into StakedSUI objects. The calculation to determine each user's relative ownership of the staking pool is done directly with the timestamp of the StakedSUI object (which determines the moment at which the deposit took place) and the change in the exchange rates between the deposit epoch and the withdrawal epoch. Each staking pool's data structure contains a time series with that pool's exchange rates. These exchange rates can be used to determine the withdrawals of any of the pool's stakers.

Stake withdrawals are processed immediately with the exchange rate prevailing at the previous epoch's exchange rate. Withdrawals do not have to wait for the current epoch to close. Withdrawals include both the original stake the user deposited and all the stake rewards accumulated up to the previous epoch. Stakers do not earn the rewards accruing to their stake during the epoch at which they withdraw. Since there is no way to know how many stake rewards will be accumulated during the current epoch until the epoch closes, these cannot be included in the withdrawal. Hence, any user can withdraw their stake immediately and receive:

SUI withdrawn at E' = ( SUI deposited at E ) * ( Exchange Rate at E'-1 / Exchange Rate at E )

### Find the exchange rate[​](#find-the-exchange-rate "Direct link to Find the exchange rate")

Each epoch change emits a `0x2::validator_set::ValidatorEpochInfo` event per validator with the exchange rate information. You can use the Events API to query events.

## Staking rewards[​](#staking-rewards "Direct link to Staking rewards")

Within a given validator staking pool, all stakers receive the same proportion of rewards through the pool's exchange rate appreciation. In addition, since validators earn commissions over the stake they manage, validators receive additional `StakedSUI` objects at the end of each epoch in proportion to the amount of commissions their staking pool earns.

Staking rewards are funded by transaction gas fees collected during the current epoch and by stake subsidies released at the end of the epoch.

StakeRewards = StakeSubsidies + GasFees

Stake subsidies are intended to subsidize the network during its early phases and are funded by a 10% allocation of SUI tokens. After this allocation depletes, the entirety of stake rewards will be made up of gas fees collected through regular network operations.

Stake rewards are made up of gas fees and stake subsidies. The total amount distributed throughout each epoch is determined as follows:

  * **Stake Subsidies:** The amount distributed in each epoch is determined prior to the beginning of the epoch according to a predefined schedule.
  * **Gas Fees:** Each epoch's amount depends on the total gas fees collected throughout the epoch. Each Sui transaction pays gas fees depending on two variables, the amount of executed gas units and the gas price: _GasFee = GasPrice _ GasUnits*

The total amount of gas fees collected corresponds to the sum of gas fees across all transactions processed in the epoch. During regular market conditions, the vast majority of transactions should have a `GasPrice` equal to the `ReferenceGasPrice`.

### User staking and rewards[​](#user-staking-and-rewards "Direct link to User staking and rewards")

A stake deposit request goes into a pending state immediately in the staking pool as soon as it is made. Sui Wallet reflects any pending stake deposit requests for the user's account. However, pending stake deposit requests do not take effect until the end of the epoch during which the request is made.

A withdrawal (un-stake) request is processed immediately as soon as it is received. The staker obtains the originally deposited SUI together with all accrued stake rewards up to the previous epoch boundary – in other words, they do not include stake rewards for the current epoch.

Users can't withdraw a portion of their active stake. They must withdraw all staked SUI at the same time. Users can, however, stake using multiple `StakedSui` objects by splitting their SUI into multiple coins. They can then perform a partial withdrawal from a validator by un-staking only some of the `StakedSUI` objects.

## Reference gas price[​](#reference-gas-price "Direct link to Reference gas price")

Sui is designed such that end-users can expect the gas price to be stable and predictable during regular network operations. This is achieved by having validators set the network's reference gas price at the beginning of each epoch.

Operationally this is achieved through a gas price survey that occurs as follows:

  * During each epoch E, each validator submits what they think the optimal reference gas price should be for the next epoch E+1.
  * At the epoch boundary, when Sui transitions from epoch E to epoch E+1, the network observes the gas price quotes across the validator set and sets the 2/3 percentile weighted by stake as the epoch's reference gas price. Hence the reference gas price is constant throughout each epoch and is only updated when the epoch changes.

For example, assume that there are seven validators with equal stake, and the price quotes they submit are `{15, 1, 4, 2, 8, 3, 23}`. The protocol sets the reference gas price at 8.

In practice, the process for submitting a gas price quote for the Gas Price Survey is a straightforward one. Each validator owns an object that contains their quote for the reference gas price. To change their response, they must update the value in that object.

For example, to set the price quote for the next epoch to 42, run:

tip

Beginning with the Sui `v1.24.1` [release](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/mainnet-v1.24.1), the `--gas-budget` flag is no longer required for CLI commands.

```

    
    
    sui client call --package <PACKAGE-ID> --module sui_system --function request_set_gas_price --args 0x5 \"42\" --gas-budget <GAS-AMOUNT>
```

Importantly, the gas object's value persists across epochs so that a validator who does not update and submit a new quote uses the same quote from the previous epoch. Hence, a validator seeking to optimize its own operations should update its quote every epoch in response to changes in network operations and market conditions.

## Validator slashing and tallying rule[​](#validator-slashing-and-tallying-rule "Direct link to Validator slashing and tallying rule")

Sui is designed to encourage and enforce community monitoring of the validator set. This is done through the Tallying Rule by which each validator monitors and scores every other validator in order to ensure that everyone is operating efficiently and in the network's best interest. Validators that receive a low score can be penalized with slashed stake rewards.

The protocol only computes the global Tallying Rule score at the epoch boundary and so relies on validators monitoring actively and changing their individual scores whenever they detect changes in other validator behavior. In general, the Tallying Rule default option should always be a score of one for all validators and only be changed to zero upon determining bad operations. In practice, the Tallying Rule consists of a set of objects each validator owns that default to scores of one and thus a validator will generally be passive and only update the object corresponding to another validator's score whenever needed.

For example, to report a validator whose Sui address is `0x44840a79dd5cf1f5efeff1379f5eece04c72db13512a2e31e8750f5176285446` as bad or non-performant, run:

```

    
    
    sui client call --package <PACKAGE-ID> --module sui_system --function report_validator --args 0x5 0x44840a79dd5cf1f5efeff1379f5eece04c72db13512a2e31e8750f5176285446 --gas-budget <GAS-AMOUNT>
```

The Tallying Rule should be implemented through a social equilibrium. The validator set should actively monitor itself and if one validator is clearly non-performant, then the other validators should score that validator with a 0 and slash its rewards. Community members can launch public dashboards tracking validator performance and that can be used as further signal into a validator's operations. There is no limit on the number of validators that can receive a 0 tallying score in an epoch.

# sui-full-node
# Sui Full Node Configuration

info

These instructions are for advanced users. If you just need a local development environment, you should instead follow the instructions in [Create a Local Sui Network](/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network) to create a local Full node, validators, and faucet.

Sui Full nodes validate blockchain activities, including transactions, checkpoints, and epoch changes. Each Full node stores and services the queries for the blockchain state and history.

This role enables validators to focus on servicing and processing transactions. When a validator commits a new set of transactions (or a block of transactions), the validator pushes that block to all connected Full nodes that then service the queries from clients.

## Features[​](#features "Direct link to Features")

Sui Full nodes:

  * Track and verify the state of the blockchain, independently and locally.
  * Serve read requests from clients.

## State synchronization[​](#state-synchronization "Direct link to State synchronization")

Sui Full nodes sync with validators to receive new transactions on the network.

A transaction requires a few round trips to 2f+1 validators to form a transaction certificate (TxCert).

This synchronization process includes:

  1. Following 2f+1 validators and listening for newly committed transactions.
  2. Making sure that 2f+1 validators recognize the transaction and that it reaches finality.
  3. Executing the transaction locally and updating the local DB.

This synchronization process requires listening to at a minimum 2f+1 validators to ensure that a Full node has properly processed all new transactions. Sui will improve the synchronization process with the introduction of checkpoints and the ability to synchronize with other Full nodes.

## Architecture[​](#architecture "Direct link to Architecture")

A Sui Full node is essentially a read-only view of the network state. Unlike validator nodes, Full nodes cannot sign transactions, although they can validate the integrity of the chain by re-executing transactions that a quorum of validators previously committed.

Today, a Sui Full node maintains the full history of the chain.

Validator nodes store only the latest transactions on the frontier of the object graph (for example, transactions with >0 unspent output objects).

## Full node setup[​](#full-node-setup "Direct link to Full node setup")

Follow the instructions here to run your own Sui Full node. Sui Full nodes run using the `sui-node` binary.

### Hardware requirements[​](#hardware-requirements "Direct link to Hardware requirements")

Suggested minimum hardware to run a Sui Full node:

  * CPUs: 8 physical cores / 16 vCPUs
  * RAM: 128 GB
  * Storage (SSD): 4 TB NVMe drive

### Software requirements[​](#software-requirements "Direct link to Software requirements")

Sui recommends running Sui Full nodes on Linux. Sui supports the Ubuntu and Debian distributions. You can run a Sui Full node on macOS, but this is only recommended for development and not for production use.

Make sure to [update Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#updating-and-uninstalling).

Use the following command to install additional Linux dependencies.

```

    
    
    sudo apt-get update \&& sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \tzdata \libprotobuf-dev \ca-certificates \build-essential \libssl-dev \libclang-dev \libpq-dev \pkg-config \openssl \protobuf-compiler \git \clang \cmake
```

## Running a Full node[​](#running-a-full-node "Direct link to Running a Full node")

Instructions for building, installing, or downloading the `sui-node` binary are available at [Sui Install](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install). These install instructions are specific to the `sui` cli, but apply to the `sui-node` binary as well.

There are many ways to run a Sui Full node (bare metal, virtual machine, Kubernetes statefulset, and so on), and the solution that you choose depends on your specific needs as well as the infrastructure that you have available.

There are some specific considerations to keep in mind when running a Sui Full node that apply to all environments:

  * [Genesis](/guides/operator/genesis): You must download the genesis blob for the network that you want to connect to, and make it available to the `sui-node`.
  * [Data Storage](/guides/operator/data-management): Sui Full nodes _can_ require a significant amount of disk space to store the blockchain history. If you plan to use your Full node to serve RPC requests, you must also plan for the storage of index files, which requires a significant amount of disk space.
  * [Monitoring](/guides/operator/monitoring): Sui Full nodes expose metrics about the node's health and the state of the Sui network.
  * [Updates](/guides/operator/updates): Sui Full nodes must be updated to the latest version to remain in sync with the network.
  * [Archival Fallback](/guides/operator/archives): The archival fallback allows you to sync checkpoints from any point in the chain's history. The network `seed-peers` below only keep a few epochs of history.

### Using Docker Compose[​](#using-docker-compose "Direct link to Using Docker Compose")

There's a guide in the Sui repository on running a Full node via [Docker Compose](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/docker/fullnode#readme). This alone is not suitable for a production environment, but can be used to get a Full node up and running quickly on a virtual machine or local machine for development purposes. Refer to [Running a Full node](#running-a-full-node) for instructions relevant to production use cases.

### Setting up a Full node[​](#setting-up-a-full-node "Direct link to Setting up a Full node")

When you are ready to run `sui-node` in your production environment, you can set up your Full node by completing the following steps:

  1. Make a copy of the [Full node YAML template](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-config/data/fullnode-template.yaml): `cp crates/sui-config/data/fullnode-template.yaml fullnode.yaml`

  2. Download the genesis blob for the network to use:

     * [Devnet genesis blob](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/devnet/genesis.blob): `curl -fLJO https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/devnet/genesis.blob`
     * [Testnet genesis blob](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/testnet/genesis.blob): `curl -fLJO https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/testnet/genesis.blob`
     * [Mainnet genesis blob](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/mainnet/genesis.blob): `curl -fLJO https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/mainnet/genesis.blob`
  3. For Testnet or Mainnet: Edit the `fullnode.yaml` file to include peer nodes for state synchronization. Append the following to the end of the current configuration:

     * Mainnet
     * Testnet

```

    
        p2p-config: seed-peers:  - address: /dns/mel-00.mainnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: d32b55bdf1737ec415df8c88b3bf91e194b59ee3127e3f38ea46fd88ba2e7849  - address: /dns/ewr-00.mainnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: c7bf6cb93ca8fdda655c47ebb85ace28e6931464564332bf63e27e90199c50ee  - address: /dns/ewr-01.mainnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: 3227f8a05f0faa1a197c075d31135a366a1c6f3d4872cb8af66c14dea3e0eb66  - address: /dns/lhr-00.mainnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: c619a5e0f8f36eac45118c1f8bda28f0f508e2839042781f1d4a9818043f732c  - address: /dns/sui-mainnet-ssfn-1.nodeinfra.com/udp/8084   peer-id: 0c52ca8d2b9f51be4a50eb44ace863c05aadc940a7bd15d4d3f498deb81d7fc6  - address: /dns/sui-mainnet-ssfn-2.nodeinfra.com/udp/8084   peer-id: 1dbc28c105aa7eb9d1d3ac07ae663ea638d91f2b99c076a52bbded296bd3ed5c  - address: /dns/sui-mainnet-ssfn-ashburn-na.overclock.run/udp/8084   peer-id: 5ff8461ab527a8f241767b268c7aaf24d0312c7b923913dd3c11ee67ef181e45  - address: /dns/sui-mainnet-ssfn-dallas-na.overclock.run/udp/8084   peer-id: e1a4f40d66f1c89559a195352ba9ff84aec28abab1d3aa1c491901a252acefa6  - address: /dns/ssn01.mainnet.sui.rpcpool.com/udp/8084   peer-id: fadb7ccb0b7fc99223419176e707f5122fef4ea686eb8e80d1778588bf5a0bcd  - address: /dns/ssn02.mainnet.sui.rpcpool.com/udp/8084   peer-id: 13783584a90025b87d4604f1991252221e5fd88cab40001642f4b00111ae9b7e
```

```

    
        p2p-config: seed-peers:  - address: /dns/yto-tnt-ssfn-01.testnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: 2ed53564d5581ded9b6773970ac2f1c84d39f9edf01308ff5a1ffe09b1add7b3  - address: /dns/yto-tnt-ssfn-00.testnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: 6563732e5ab33b4ae09c73a98fd37499b71b8f03c27b5cc51acc26934974aff2  - address: /dns/nrt-tnt-ssfn-00.testnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: 23a1f7cd901b6277cbedaa986b3fc183f171d800cabba863d48f698f518967e1  - address: /dns/ewr-tnt-ssfn-00.testnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: df8a8d128051c249e224f95fcc463f518a0ebed8986bbdcc11ed751181fecd38  - address: /dns/lax-tnt-ssfn-00.testnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: f9a72a0a6c17eed09c27898eab389add704777c03e135846da2428f516a0c11d  - address: /dns/lhr-tnt-ssfn-00.testnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: 9393d6056bb9c9d8475a3cf3525c747257f17c6a698a7062cbbd1875bc6ef71e  - address: /dns/mel-tnt-ssfn-00.testnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: c88742f46e66a11cb8c84aca488065661401ef66f726cb9afeb8a5786d83456e
```

  4. Optional: Set up the [Archival Fallback](/guides/operator/archives), which allows you to sync checkpoints if you fall behind the network's `seed-peers`.

  5. Optional: Skip this step to accept the default paths to resources. Edit the fullnode.yaml file to use custom paths.

  6. Update the `db-path` field with the path to the Full node database. `db-path: "/db-files/sui-fullnode"`

  7. Update the `genesis-file-location` with the path to genesis.blob.

```

    
        genesis:  genesis-file-location: "/sui-fullnode/genesis.blob"
```

### Starting your Full node[​](#starting-a-full-node "Direct link to Starting your Full node")

You should not start syncing your Full node from the start of the genesis. This will take a very long time and consume a lot of resources (including likely filling up your disk).

Instead, start your Full node from a recent snapshot. You can find details on how to obtain a snapshot from the [Sui Snapshots guide](/guides/operator/snapshots).

Now that you have your Full node config file set up, and you've obtained a snapshot, you can start your Full node by running the `sui-node` binary with your `fullnode.yaml` configuration file:

```

    
    
    sui-node --config-path fullnode.yaml
```

It's a good idea to use something like systemd to manage your Full node in a production environment.

### Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

If you receive a `cannot find -lpq` error, you are missing the `libpq` library. Use `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev` to install on Linux, or `brew install libpq` on MacOS. After you install on MacOS, create a Homebrew link using `brew link --force libpq`. For further context, reference the [issue on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70313347/ld-library-not-found-for-lpq-when-build-rust-in-macos?rq=1).

If you receive the following error:

```

    
    
    panicked at error binding to 0.0.0.0:9184: error creating server listener: Address already in use (os error 98)
```

Then update the metrics address in your fullnode.yaml file to use port `9180`.

```

    
    
    metrics-address: "0.0.0.0:9180"
```

# genesis
# Genesis

Genesis is the initial state of the Sui blockchain. To launch a network, the initial committee of validators collaborate by providing their validator information (public keys, network addresses, and so on) to a shared workspace. After all of the initial validators have contributed their information, Sui generates the initial, unsigned genesis checkpoint (checkpoint with sequence number 0) and each validator provides their signature. Sui aggregates these signatures to form a certificate on the genesis checkpoint. Sui bundles this checkpoint, as well as the initial objects, together into a single genesis.blob file that is used to initialize the state when running the `sui-node` binary for both validators and Full nodes.

## Genesis blob locations[​](#genesis-blob-locations "Direct link to Genesis blob locations")

The genesis.blob files for each network are in the [sui-genesis](https://github.com/mystenlabs/sui-genesis) repository.

See [Sui Full Node](/guides/operator/sui-full-node#set-up-from-source) for how to get the genesis.blob file for each network.

# Sui Node Monitoring

info

These instructions are for advanced users. If you just need a local development environment, you should instead follow the instructions in [Create a Local Sui Network](/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network) to create a local Full node, validators, and faucet.

Nodes expose on `localhost:9184/metrics` by default.

You can view the metrics in the metrics UI, or you can use a tool like `curl` to get the metrics in a format that is easy to parse.

```

    
    
    curl -s http://localhost:9184/metrics | grep -E 'sui_validator|sui_fullnode'
```

## Production monitoring[​](#production-monitoring "Direct link to Production monitoring")

For production monitoring, we recommend using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

You can use grafana agent, grafana alloy, or another tool to scrape the metrics from your node.

# updates
# Updating a Full Node

## Sui release process[​](#sui-release-process "Direct link to Sui release process")

Each Sui network is deployed on a consistent schedule. There are extenuating circumstances that might delay releases occasionally, but these delays are rare and communicated through [official channels](#communication).

  * `devnet`: Deployed every week on Mondays.
  * `testnet`: Deployed every week on Tuesdays.
  * `mainnet`: Deployed every two weeks on Wednesdays.

info

For additional details, see each network's [release schedule and configuration](https://sui.io/networkinfo).

Whenever Sui releases a new version, you must update your Full node with the release to ensure compatibility with the network it connects to. For example, if you use Sui Testnet you should install the version of Sui running on Sui Testnet.

Any release that contains a protocol change will need to be followed before the protocol upgrade takes place (when enough stake within the validator set upgrades, the new protocol version is enacted in the next epoch). If you do not update your Full node, you will not be able to connect to the network after the protocol upgrade takes place.

## Update your Full node[​](#update-your-full-node "Direct link to Update your Full node")

You can track the latest version of Sui on the [Sui Releases](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases) page on GitHub. The schedule for each network is available in the [Network Release Schedule](https://sui.io/networkinfo) page.

It is reasonable to have to shut down your Full node to perform an update, whether that be a rolling restart in Kubernetes, or a systemctl stop on a Linux machine to replace the sui-node binary.

# snapshots
# Database Snapshots

Database snapshots provide a point-in-time view of a database's store. In Sui, the database snapshot captures a running database's view of the Sui network from a particular node at the end of an epoch. While validators can enable snapshots, they are typically most valuable for Full node operators.

Snapshots of the Sui network enable Full node operators a way to bootstrap a Full node without having to execute all the transactions that occurred after genesis. You can upload snapshots to remote object stores like S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and similar services. These services typically run the export process in the background so there is no degradation in performance for your Full node. With snapshots stored in the cloud, you're more easily able to recover quickly from catastrophic failures in your system or hardware.

To maintain a healthy Sui network, Sui encourages the Sui community to bring up additional snapshots to ensure stronger data availability across the network.

## Supported snapshot types[​](#supported-snapshot-types "Direct link to Supported snapshot types")

Sui supports two types of snapshots:

  * **RocksDB snapshots** are a point-in-time view of a database store. This means that the snapshot keeps the state of the system at the moment it generates the snapshot, including non-pruned data, additional indices, and other data.
  * **Formal snapshots** are database agnostic with a minimalistic format, in other words they contain only the data necessary to restore a node to a valid state at the specified epoch, thus they have a much smaller storage footprint and are generally faster to restore from when compared to database snapshots. Formal snapshots are also supported natively by the Sui protocol. In this context, this means that we can cryptographically verify the contents of the formal snapshot against a commitment from the committee at the epoch we are restoring to. This verification happens automatically and by default during a Formal snapshot restore (unless explicitly bypassed).

info

Formal snapshots are not suitable for use if you are running an RPC node that does any historical data lookups. For more information on node data management, see [Data Management](/guides/operator/data-management).

You can configure a Full node snapshot to generate a state snapshot at the end of each epoch. A single Full node can generate RocksDB snapshots, Formal snapshots, or both.

## Formal snapshots[​](#formal-snapshots "Direct link to Formal snapshots")

Formal snapshots provide a mechanism for a node to restore to a canonical state (the state of a full pruned and compacted node at the end of an epoch) at some prior point in time without having to execute all the transactions that have occurred since genesis. Unlike existing database snapshots, these formal snapshots have the following properties:

  1. **Minimalism:** Formal snapshots currently contain only the end of epoch live object set (the set of all object versions eligible for use as input objects for future transactions). Sui syncs all other critical chain information from the chain or derives it. Thus, formal snapshots contain only the necessary data required for a node to startup at epoch boundary and participate in the network.
  2. **Agnosticism:** Formal snapshots are by nature agnostic to the underlying database choice or implementation of the protocol. As the live object set is protocol defined, so is the formal snapshot.
  3. **Verifiability:** Formal snapshots have first-class support in the core Sui protocol. As such, they must be trustless/verifiable by the node operator upon download. To support this, the protocol signs a commitment to the live object state at end of epoch, which formal snapshots are checked against at restore time. If this verification fails, the node state is moved back to the state before the snapshot restore attempt.

Because these snapshots do not contain indexes, they are most immediately useful for validators and state sync Full nodes (SSFNs). You can upload snapshots to remote object stores like S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and similar services. These services typically run the export process in the background so there is no degradation in performance for your Full node. With snapshots stored in the cloud, you can recover from catastrophic failures in your system or hardware more efficiently.

## Restoring a Full node using snapshots[​](#restoring-a-full-node-using-snapshots "Direct link to Restoring a Full node using snapshots")

### Restoring using RocksDB snapshots[​](#restoring-using-rocksdb-snapshots "Direct link to Restoring using RocksDB snapshots")

To restore from a RocksDB snapshot, follow these steps:

  1. Download the snapshot for the epoch you want to restore to your local disk. There is one snapshot per epoch in s3 bucket.

  2. Place the snapshot into the directory that the `db-config` value points to in your fullnode.yaml file. For example, if the `db-config` value points to `/opt/sui/db/authorities_db/full_node_db` and you want to restore from epoch 10, then copy the snapshot to the directory with this command:

You can use the aws cli (provided you have credentials to associate with the download): `aws s3 cp s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/epoch_10 /opt/sui/db/authorities_db/full_node_db/live --recursive --request-payer`.

An alternative is to use `sui-tool` to copy the files:

```

    
        sui-tool download-db-snapshot --latest \  --network <NETWORK> --snapshot-bucket <BUCKET-NAME> \  --snapshot-bucket-type <TYPE> --path <PATH-TO-NODE-DB> \  --num-parallel-downloads 25 \  --skip-indexes \  --no-sign-request
```

     * `--epoch`: The epoch that you want to download. Mysten Labs hosted buckets will only keep the last 90 epochs, you can check the most recent epoch on sui explorers like [suivision](https://suivision.xyz/) or [suiscan](https://suiscan.xyz/).
     * `--latest`: Rather than explicitly passing a epoch via `--epoch`, you can pass the `--latest` flag, which will automatically select the latest snapshot`
     * `--network`: Network to download snapshot for. Defaults to "mainnet".
     * `--path`: Path to snapshot directory on local filesystem.
     * `--no-sign-request`: If set, `--snapshot-bucket` and `--snapshot-bucket-type` are ignored, and a static Cloudflare R2 bucket is used.
     * `--snapshot-bucket`: Source snapshot bucket name, eg `mysten-mainnet-snapshots`. This cannot be used with `--no-sign-request`.
     * `--snapshot-bucket-type`: Snapshot bucket type. GCS and S3 currently supported. This cannot be used with `--no-sign-request`.
     * `--skip-indexes`: Skips downloading the very large `indexes/` dir, used by jsonrpc on the fullnode

The following environment variables are used if `--no-sign-request` is not set:

     * _AWS_ : `AWS_SNAPSHOT_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SNAPSHOT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SNAPSHOT_REGION`
     * _GCS_ : `GCS_SNAPSHOT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE_PATH`
     * _AZURE_ : `AZURE_SNAPSHOT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, `AZURE_SNAPSHOT_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`
  3. When using `sui-tool download-db-snapshot` the database is copied to the location you pass to `--path`, in a directory named `epoch_[NUM]`. Rename the `epoch_[NUM]` directory to `live/` under your node's `db_path`, for example `cp -r /tmp/epoch_[NUM] /opt/sui/db/authorities_db/full_node_db/live`.

  4. Make sure you update the ownership of the downloaded directory to the sui user (whichever linux user you run `sui-node` as) `sudo chown -R sui:sui /opt/sui/db/authorities_db/full_node_db/live`.

  5. Start the Sui node.

info

When you restore a Full node from a snapshot, write it to the path `/opt/sui/db/authorities_db/full_node_db/live`. When restoring a Validator node, you can shorten the database destination to `/opt/sui/db/authorities_db/live`. Check the `db_path` field of your Full node or Validator configs to confirm the path location.

### Restoring using Formal snapshots[​](#restoring-using-formal-snapshots "Direct link to Restoring using Formal snapshots")

To restore using a Formal snapshot, use the `sui-tool` binary. `sui-tool` can be downloaded along with other sui binaries. See [Install Sui](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) for more details.

The following steps can be used to restore a node from a Formal snapshot:

  1. If it's running, stop the node.

  2. Run the command:

```

    
        sui-tool download-formal-snapshot --latest --genesis "<PATH-TO-GENESIS-BLOB>" \   --network <NETWORK> --snapshot-bucket <BUCKET-NAME> --snapshot-bucket-type <TYPE> \   --path <PATH-TO-NODE-DB> --num-parallel-downloads 50 --no-sign-request
```

     * `--epoch`: The epoch that you want to download. Mysten Labs hosted buckets will only keep the last 90 epochs, you can check the most recent epoch on sui explorers like [suivision](https://suivision.xyz/) or [suiscan](https://suiscan.xyz/).
     * `--latest`: Rather than explicitly passing a epoch via `--epoch`, you can pass the `--latest` flag, which will automatically select the latest snapshot`
     * `--genesis`: The path to the location of the network's `genesis.blob`.
     * `--network`: Network to download snapshot for. Defaults to "mainnet".
     * `--path`: Path to snapshot directory on local filesystem.
     * `--no-sign-request`: If set, `--snapshot-bucket` and `--snapshot-bucket-type` are ignored, and Cloudflare R2 is used.
     * `--snapshot-bucket`: Source snapshot bucket name, eg `mysten-mainnet-snapshots`. This cannot be used with `--no-sign-request`.
     * `--snapshot-bucket-type`: Snapshot bucket type. GCS and S3 currently supported. This cannot be used with `--no-sign-request`.

The following environment variables are used if `--no-sign-request` is not set:

     * _AWS_ : `AWS_SNAPSHOT_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SNAPSHOT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SNAPSHOT_REGION`
     * _GCS_ : `GCS_SNAPSHOT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE_PATH`
     * _AZURE_ : `AZURE_SNAPSHOT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, `AZURE_SNAPSHOT_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`

## Mysten Labs managed snapshots[​](#mysten-labs-managed-snapshots "Direct link to Mysten Labs managed snapshots")

Mysten Labs hosts two tiers of snapshot storage access. **High throughput, Requester Pays enabled buckets** , and **free, permissionless buckets**.

**High throughput, Requester Pays enabled buckets:**

  * GCS and S3 are both setup with requester pays. This means that you'll need to provide a set of valid AWS/GCP credentials when downloading from these buckets. [Requester Pays](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/requester-pays) means you are charged for the egress costs of pulling the snapshot data.
  * If you are looking for the best download speeds, we recommend using the S3 buckets with [transfer acceleration](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/transfer-acceleration/) enabled.

**Free, permissionless buckets:**

  * These are currently hosted on Cloudflare R2, currently only in North America, but we plan on adding more regions soon.
  * Since the bucket is open to the internet, there's no need to provide any cloud credentials.

### Bucket Names[​](#bucket-names "Direct link to Bucket Names")

**S3** Testnet: `s3://mysten-testnet-snapshots/`, `s3://mysten-testnet-formal/` Mainnet: `s3://mysten-mainnet-snapshots/`, `s3://mysten-mainnet-formal/`

**GCS** Testnet: `gs://mysten-testnet-snapshots/`, `gs://mysten-testnet-formal/` Mainnet: `gs://mysten-mainnet-snapshots/`, `gs://mysten-mainnet-formal/`

![Mysten Managed Snapshots](/assets/images/mysten-cloud-snapshots-993465e96fe5caff1213e9517ea38937.png)

## Enabling snapshots[​](#enabling-snapshots "Direct link to Enabling snapshots")

Full nodes do not take snapshots by default. To enable this feature you must apply specific configs to your Full node.

Follow these steps to change the configs for a Full node:

  1. Stop your node, if it's running.
  2. Open your fullnode.yaml config file and apply config updates as the following sections show.
  3. Save the fullnode.yaml file and restart the node.

### Enabling DB snapshots[​](#enabling-db-snapshots "Direct link to Enabling DB snapshots")

Add an entry to the config file for `db-checkpoint-config`. Using Amazon's S3 service as an example:

```

    
    
    db-checkpoint-config:perform-db-checkpoints-at-epoch-end:trueperform-index-db-checkpoints-at-epoch-end:trueobject-store-config:object-store:"S3"bucket:"<BUCKET-NAME>"aws-access-key-id: “<ACCESS-KEY>”aws-secret-access-key: “<SHARED-KEY>”aws-region:"<BUCKET-REGION>"object-store-connection-limit:20
```

  * `object-store`: The remote object store to upload snapshots. Set as Amazon's `S3` service in the example.
  * `bucket`: The S3 bucket name to store the snapshots.
  * `aws-access-key-id` and `aws-secret-access-key`: AWS authentication information with write access to the bucket.
  * `aws-region`: Region where bucket exists.
  * `object-store-connection-limit`: Number of simultaneous connections to the object store.

### Enabling Formal snapshots[​](#enabling-formal-snapshots "Direct link to Enabling Formal snapshots")

Add an entry to the config file for `state-snapshot-write-config`. Using Amazon's S3 service as an example:

```

    
    
    state-snapshot-write-config:object-store-config:object-store:"S3"bucket:"<BUCKET-NAME>"aws-access-key-id: “<ACCESS-KEY>”aws-secret-access-key: “<SHARED-KEY>”aws-region:"<BUCKET-REGION>"object-store-connection-limit:200
```

The configuration settings shown in the example are specific to AWS S3, but GCS, Azure Storage, and Cloudflare R2 are all supported.

# archives
# Sui Archives

A Sui archive is a history of all transaction data on Sui, trailing behind the latest checkpoint by 10 minutes. As a Sui node operator, you can write this history to an object store like S3, GCS, or similar for safe keeping. Saving this archive data is considered a best practice because Sui prunes transactions on Full nodes to remove historical transactions and their effects. Peer nodes, for example, might not catch up with all transactions and effects through synchronization if they lag behind the current epoch by more than the latest few epochs. Instead of relying on synchronization, peer nodes can fallback to downloading this information from an archive.

Sui Archival nodes (Full nodes that write to an archive) don't store historical state on local storage and don't help query historical data. They serve the purpose of enabling peer nodes to catch up to the latest checkpoint and are useful for auditing and verifying the complete history of all transactions on the network.

## Create an Archival node[​](#create-an-archival-node "Direct link to Create an Archival node")

To start storing transaction history as an archive, you need to modify your node configuration. Open your fullnode.yaml file and add the following configuration. By default, the fullnode.yaml file is located in your `~/.sui/sui_config` directory.

```

    
    
    state-archive-write-config:object-store-config:object-store:"S3"bucket:"<bucket_name>"aws-access-key-id:"<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>"aws-secret-access-key:"<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"aws-region:"<aws_region>"object-store-connection-limit:20concurrency:5use-for-pruning-watermark:falsestate-archive-read-config:-object-store-config:object-store:"S3"# Use the same bucket which is being used in `state-archive-write-config`bucket:"<bucket_name>"aws-access-key-id:"<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>"aws-secret-access-key:"<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"aws-region:"<aws_region>"object-store-connection-limit:20concurrency:5# This should be set to true in this case. Setting this to true# would prevent pruning of local transaction data until it is archived# in the bucketuse-for-pruning-watermark:true
```

## Set up archival fallback[​](#set-up-archival-fallback "Direct link to Set up archival fallback")

To enable your node to fallback to an archive in case of lag, add this to your fullnode.yaml file:

  * Amazon S3
  * Google Cloud Storage

```

    
    
    state-archive-read-config:-object-store-config:object-store:"S3"# Use mysten-testnet-archives for testnet # Use mysten-mainnet-archives for mainnetbucket:"mysten-<testnet|mainnet>-archives"# you can either provide your own aws credentials via "aws-secret-access-key" and# "aws-access-key-id" or set no-sign-request: trueno-sign-request:trueaws-region:"us-west-2"object-store-connection-limit:20# How many objects to read ahead when catching up concurrency:5# Whether to prune local state based on latest checkpoint in archive.# This should stay false for most use casesuse-for-pruning-watermark:false
```

```

    
    
    state-archive-read-config:-object-store-config:object-store:"GCS"# Use mysten-mainnet-archives for mainnet# Notice there is no archive bucket setup for testnet in GCSbucket:"mysten-<testnet|mainnet>-archives"# Use your gcloud service account credentialsgoogle-service-account:"</path/to/service/account/credentials>"object-store-connection-limit:20# How many objects to read ahead when catching up concurrency:5# Whether to prune local state based on latest checkpoint in archive.# This should stay false for most use casesuse-for-pruning-watermark:false
```

Even though these buckets are publicly readable, you need to make sure to properly grant the correct policies to read them via AWS, for example:

```

    
    
    {  "Version": "2012-10-17",  "Statement": [    {      "Action": [        "s3:ListBucket",        "s3:GetObject",      ],      "Effect": "Allow",      "Resource": [        "arn:aws:s3:::mysten-mainnet-archives/*",        "arn:aws:s3:::mysten-mainnet-archives"      ]    }  ]}
```

# node-tools
# Node Tools

This guide focuses on using the Sui CLI `validator` commands.

info

This tool only supports pending validators and active validators at the moment.

## Preparation[​](#preparation "Direct link to Preparation")

  1. Make sure you have completed all the [prerequisites](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install#prerequisites).

  2. Build the `sui` binary, which you need for the genesis ceremony. This step can be done on any machine you like. It does not have to be done on the machine on which you will run the validator.

    1. Clone the git repo:

`git clone git@github.com:MystenLabs/sui.git && cd sui`

    2. Check out the commit to use for the testnet:

`git checkout testnet`

    3. Build sui binary

`cargo build --bin sui`

    4. Remember the path to your binary:

`export SUI_BINARY="$(pwd)/target/debug/sui"`

  3. Run the following command to set up your Sui account and CLI environment.

    1. If this is the first time running this program, it will ask you to provide a Sui Fullnode Server URL and a meaningful environment alias. It will also generate a random key pair in `sui.keystore` and a config `client.yaml`. Swap in your validator account key if you already have one.

    2. If you already set it up, simply make sure a. `rpc` is correct in `client.yaml`. b. `active_address` is correct in `client.yaml`. b. `sui.keystore` contains your account key pair.

If at this point you can't find where `client.yaml` or `sui.keystore` is or have other questions, read [Sui Client CLI tutorial](/references/cli/client).

```

        
                $ sui client
    ```

  4. To test you are connected to the network and configured your config correctly, run the following command to display your validator info.

```

    
    
    $ sui validator display-metadata
```

## Using Sui CLI[​](#using-sui-cli "Direct link to Using Sui CLI")

#### Print help info[​](#print-help-info "Direct link to Print help info")

```

    
    
    $ sui validator --help
```

#### Display validator metadata[​](#display-validator-metadata "Direct link to Display validator metadata")

```

    
    
    $ sui validator display-metadata
```

or

```

    
    
    $ sui validator display-metadata <validator-address>
```

to print another validator's information.

#### Update validator metadata[​](#update-validator-metadata "Direct link to Update validator metadata")

Run the following to see how to update validator metadata. Read description carefully about when the change will take effect.

```

    
    
    $ sui validator update-metadata --help
```

You can update the following on-chain metadata:

  1. name
  2. description
  3. image URL
  4. project URL
  5. network address
  6. p2p address
  7. primary address
  8. worker address
  9. protocol public key
  10. network public key
  11. worker public key

Notably, only the first 4 metadata listed above take effect immediately.

If you change any metadata from points 5 to 11, they will be changed only after the next epoch - for these, you'll want to restart the validator program immediately after the next epoch, with the new key files and/or updated `validator.yaml` config. Particularly, make sure the new address is not behind a firewall.

Run the following to see how to update each metadata.

```

    
    
    $ sui validator update-metadata --help
```

#### Operation cap[​](#operation-cap "Direct link to Operation cap")

Operation Cap allows a validator to authorizer another account to perform certain actions on behalf of this validator. Read about [Operation Cap here](/guides/operator/validator-tasks#operation-cap).

The Operation Cap holder (either the valdiator itself or the delegatee) updates its Gas Price and reports validator peers with the Operation Cap.

#### Update gas price[​](#update-gas-price "Direct link to Update gas price")

To update Gas Price, run

```

    
    
    $ sui validator update-gas-price <gas-price>
```

if the account itself is a validator and holds the Operation Cap. Or

```

    
    
    $ sui validator update-gas-price --operation-cap-id <operation-cap-id> <gas-price>
```

if the account is a delegatee.

#### Report validators[​](#report-validators "Direct link to Report validators")

To report validators peers, run

```

    
    
    $ sui validator report-validator <reportee-address>
```

Add `--undo-report false` if it intents to undo an existing report.

Similarly, if the account is a delegatee, add `--operation-cap-id <operation-cap-id>` option to the command.

if the account itself is a validator and holds the Operation Cap. Or

```

    
    
    $ sui validator update-gas-price --operation-cap-id <operation-cap-id> <gas-price>
```

if the account is a delegatee.

#### Become a validator / join committee[​](#become-a-validator--join-committee "Direct link to Become a validator / join committee")

To become a validator candidate, first run

```

    
    
    $ sui validator make-validator-info <name> <description> <image-url> <project-url> <host-name> <gas_price>
```

This will generate a `validator.info` file and key pair files. The output of this command includes:

  1. Four key pair files (Read [more here](/guides/operator/validator-tasks#key-management)). ==Set their permissions with the minimal visibility (chmod 600, for example) and store them securely==. They are needed when running the validator node as covered below. a. If you follow this guide thoroughly, this key pair is actually copied from your `sui.keystore` file.
  2. `validator.info` file that contains your validator info. **Double check all information is correct**.

Then run

```

    
    
    $ sui validator become-candidate {path-to}validator.info
```

to submit an on-chain transaction to become a validator candidate. The parameter is the file path to the validator.info generated in the previous step. **Make sure the transaction succeeded (printed in the output).**

At this point you are validator candidate and can start to accept self staking and delegated staking.

**If you haven't, start a fullnode now to catch up with the network. When you officially join the committee but is not fully up-to-date, you cannot make meaningful contribution to the network and may be subject to peer reporting hence face the risk of reduced staking rewards for you and your delegators.**

Once you collect enough staking amount, run

```

    
    
    $ sui validator join-committee
```

to become a pending validator. A pending validator will become active and join the committee starting from next epoch.

#### Leave committee[​](#leave-committee "Direct link to Leave committee")

To leave committee, run

```

    
    
    $ sui validator leave-committee
```

Then you will be removed from committee starting from next epoch.

### Generate the payload to create PoP[​](#generate-the-payload-to-create-pop "Direct link to Generate the payload to create PoP")

Serialize the payload that is used to generate Proof of Possession. This is allows the signer to take the payload offline for an Authority protocol BLS keypair to sign.

```

# exchange-integration
# Sui Exchange Integration Guide

This topic describes how to integrate SUI, the token native to the Sui network, into a cryptocurrency exchange. The specific requirements and processes to implement an integration vary between exchanges. Rather than provide a step-by-step guide, this topic provides information about the primary tasks necessary to complete an integration. After the guidance about how to configure an integration, you can also find information and code samples related to staking on the Sui network.

## Requirements to configure a SUI integration[​](#requirements-to-configure-a-sui-integration "Direct link to Requirements to configure a SUI integration")

The requirements to configure a SUI integration include:

  * A Sui Full node. You can operate your own Sui Full node or use a Full node from a node operator.
  * Suggested hardware requirements to run a Sui Full node: 
    * CPU: 8 physical cores / 16 vCPUs
    * RAM: 128 GB
    * Storage (SSD): 4 TB NVMe drive

For best results, run Sui Full nodes on Linux. Sui supports the Ubuntu and Debian distributions. You can also fun a Full node on macOS.

## Configure a Sui Full node[​](#configure-a-sui-full-node "Direct link to Configure a Sui Full node")

You can set up and configure a [Sui Full node](/guides/operator/sui-full-node) using Docker or directly from source code in the Sui GitHub repository.

## Set up Sui addresses[​](#set-up-sui-addresses "Direct link to Set up Sui addresses")

Sui addresses do not require on-chain initialization, you can spend from an address if it corresponds to your private key. You can derive a 32-byte Sui address by hashing the signature scheme flag byte concatenated with public key bytes `flag || pubkey` using the [BLAKE2b](https://www.blake2.net/) (256 bits output) hashing function.

Currently, Sui address supports these signature schemes: pure Ed25519, Secp256k1, Secp256r1 and multisig. The corresponding flag bytes are 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 respectively.

The following code sample demonstrates how to derive a Sui address in Rust:

```

    
    
    let flag =0x00;// 0x00 = ED25519, 0x01 = Secp256k1, 0x02 = Secp256r1, 0x03 = multiSig// Hash the [flag, public key] bytearray using Blake2bletmut hasher =DefaultHash::default();hasher.update([flag]);hasher.update(pk);let arr = hasher.finalize();let sui_address_string =hex::encode(arr);
```

## Displaying addresses[​](#displaying-addresses "Direct link to Displaying addresses")

Sui supports both addresses with and without a `0x` prefix. Sui recommends that you always include the `0x` prefix in API calls and when you display user addresses.

## Track balance changes for an address[​](#track-balance-changes-for-an-address "Direct link to Track balance changes for an address")

You can track balance changes by calling `sui_getBalance` at predefined intervals. This call returns the total balance for an address. The total includes any coin or token type, but this document focuses on SUI. You can track changes in the total balance for an address between subsequent `sui_getBalance` requests.

The following bash example demonstrates how to use `sui_getBalance` for address `0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3`. If you use a network other than Devnet, replace the value for `rpc` with the URL to the appropriate Full node.

```

    
    
    rpc="https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443"address="0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3"data="{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"sui_getBalance\", \"id\": 1, \"params\": [\"$address\"]}"curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data-raw "$data" $rpc
```

The response is a JSON object that includes the `totalBalance` for the address:

```

    
    
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"coinType":"0x2::sui::SUI","coinObjectCount":40,"totalBalance":10000000000,"lockedBalance":{}},"id":1}
```

The following example demonstrates using `sui_getBalance` in Rust:

```

    
    
    usestd::str::FromStr;usesui_sdk::types::base_types::SuiAddress;usesui_sdk::{SuiClient,SuiClientBuilder};#[tokio::main]asyncfnmain()->Result<(),anyhow::Error>{let sui =SuiClientBuilder::default().build("https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443",).await.unwrap();let address =SuiAddress::from_str("0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3")?;let objects = sui.read_api().get_balance(address).await?;println!("{:?}", objects);Ok(())}
```

## Use events to track balance changes for an address[​](#use-events-to-track-balance-changes-for-an-address "Direct link to Use events to track balance changes for an address")

You can also track the balance for an address by subscribing to all of the events emitted from it. Use a filter to include only the events related to SUI coins, such as when the address acquires a coin or pays for a gas fee. The following example demonstrates how to filter events for an address using bash and cURL:

```

    
    
    rpc="https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443"address="0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3"data="{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\":1, \"method\": \"sui_getEvents\", \"params\": [{\"Recipient\": {\"AddressOwner\": \"0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3\"}}, null, null, true ]}"curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data-raw "$data" $rpc
```

The response can include a large number of events. Add pagination to the response using the `nextCursor` key in the request. You can determine the corresponding `txDigest` and `eventSeq` from the `id` field of a transaction.

You can add the `txDigest` value instead of the first `null` within the `params`. The second `null` is an integer that defines how many results (up to 1000) to return and the `true` means ascending order. You can use the `nextCursor` so the response starts from a desired point.

The `id` field of any transaction looks like:

```

    
    
    "id": {  "txDigest": "GZQN9pE3Zr9ZfLzBK1BfVCXtbjx5xKMxPSEKaHDvL3E2",  "eventSeq": 6019}
```

With this data, create a `nextCursor` as follows:

```

    
    
    nextCursor : {"txDigest": "GZQN9pE3Zr9ZfLzBK1BfVCXtbjx5xKMxPSEKaHDvL3E2","eventSeq": 6019}
```

## Blocks vs checkpoints[​](#blocks-vs-checkpoints "Direct link to Blocks vs checkpoints")

Sui is a DAG-based blockchain and uses checkpoints for node synchronization and global transaction ordering. Checkpoints differ from blocks in the following ways:

  * Sui creates checkpoints and adds finalized transactions. Note that transactions are finalized even before they are included in a checkpoint
  * Checkpoints do not fork, roll back, or reorganize.
  * Sui creates about four checkpoints every second. Find the most up-to-date statistic on the [Sui public dashboard](https://metrics.sui.io/public-dashboards/4ceb11cc210d4025b122294586961169).

### Checkpoint API operations[​](#checkpoint-api-operations "Direct link to Checkpoint API operations")

Sui Checkpoint API operations include:

  * [sui_getCheckpoint](/sui-api-ref#sui_getCheckpoint) - Retrieves the specified checkpoint.
  * [sui_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber](/sui-api-ref#sui_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber) - Retrieves the sequence number of the most recently executed checkpoint.
  * [sui_getCheckpoints](/sui-api-ref#sui_getCheckpoints) - Retrieves a paginated list of checkpoints that occurred during the specified interval. Pending a future release.

## SUI balance transfer[​](#sui-balance-transfer "Direct link to SUI balance transfer")

To transfer a specific amount of SUI between addresses, you need a SUI token object with that specific value. In Sui, everything is an object, including SUI tokens. The amount of SUI in each SUI token object varies. For example, an address could own 3 SUI tokens with different values: one of 0.1 SUI, a second of 1.0 SUI, and a third with 0.005 SUI. The total balance for the address equals the sum of the values of the individual SUI token objects, in this case, 1.105 SUI.

You can merge and split SUI token objects to create token objects with specific values. To create a SUI token worth .6 SUI, split the token worth 1 SUI into two token objects worth .6 SUI and .4 SUI.

To transfer a specific amount of SUI, you need a SUI token worth that specific amount. To get a SUI token with that specific value, you might need to split or merge existing SUI tokens. Sui supports several methods to accomplish this, including some that do not require you to manually split or merge coins.

## Sui API operations for transfers[​](#sui-api-operations-for-transfers "Direct link to Sui API operations for transfers")

Sui supports the following API operations related to transferring SUI between addresses:

  * [sui_transferObject](/sui-api-ref#sui_transferObject) Because SUI tokens are objects, you can transfer SUI tokens just like any other object. This method requires a gas token, and is useful in niche cases only.

  * [sui_payAllSui](/sui-api-ref#sui_payAllSui) This method accepts an array of SUI token IDs. It merges all existing tokens into one, deducts the gas fee, then sends the merged token to the recipient address.

The method is especially useful if you want to transfer all SUI from an address. To merge together all coins for an address, set the recipient as the same address. This is a native Sui method so is not considered a transaction in Sui.

  * [sui_paySui](/sui-api-ref#sui_paySui) This operation accepts an array of SUI token IDs, an array of amounts, and an array of recipient addresses.

The amounts and recipients array map one to one. Even if you use only one recipient address, you must include it for each amount in the amount array.

The operation merges all of the tokens provided into one token object and settles the gas fees. It then splits the token according to the amounts in the amounts array and sends the first token to the first recipient, the second token to the second recipient, and so on. Any remaining SUI on the token stays in the source address.

The benefits of this method include: no gas fees for merging or splitting tokens, and the abstracted token merge and split. The `sui_paySui` operation is a native function, so the merge and split operations are not considered Sui transactions. The gas fees for them match typical transactions on Sui.You can use this operation to split coins in your own address by setting the recipient as your own address. Note that the total value of the input coins must be greater than the total value of the amounts to send.

  * [sui_pay](/sui-api-ref#sui_pay) This method is similar to sui_paySui, but it accepts any kind of coin or token instead of only SUI. You must include a gas token, and all of the coins or tokens must be the same type.

  * [sui_transferSui](/sui-api-ref#sui_transferSui) This method accepts only one SUI token object and an amount to send to the recipient. It uses the same token for gas fees, so the amount to transfer must be strictly less than the value of the SUI token used.

## Signing transactions[​](#signing-transactions "Direct link to Signing transactions")

Refer to [Sui Signatures](/concepts/cryptography/transaction-auth/signatures) for more details on signature validity requirements.

## SUI Staking[​](#sui-staking "Direct link to SUI Staking")

The Sui blockchain uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake mechanism (DPoS). This allows SUI token holders to stake their SUI tokens to any validator of their choice. When someone stakes their SUI tokens, it means those tokens are locked for the entire epoch. Users can withdraw their stake at any time, but new staking requests become active only at the start of the next epoch.

SUI holders who stake their tokens to validators earn rewards for helping secure the Sui network. Sui determines rewards for staking based on stake rewards on the network, and distributes them at the end of each epoch.

The total voting power in the Sui Network is always 10,000. The voting power of each individual validator is similar to basis points. For example, a voting power of 101 = 1.01%. Sui's quorum threshold (number of votes needed to confirm a transaction) is 6,667 (which is greater than 2/3). The voting power for a single validator is capped at 1,000 (10%) regardless of how much stake the validator has.

## Staking functions[​](#staking-functions "Direct link to Staking functions")

Sui supports the following API operations related to staking. You can find the source code in the [sui_system](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-system/sources/sui_system.move) module.

  * `request_add_stake` Add user stake to a validator's staking pool.

```

    
    
    publicfunrequest_add_stake(self: &mut SuiSystemState,stake: Coin<SUI>,validator_address: address,ctx: &mut TxContext,) {  validator_set::request_add_stake(    &mut self.validators,    validator_address,    coin::into_balance(stake),    option::none(),    ctx,  );}
```

  * `request_add_stake_mul_coin` Add user stake to a validator's staking pool using multiple coins.

```

    
    
    publicfunrequest_add_stake_mul_coin(self: &mut SuiSystemState,delegate_stakes: vector<Coin<SUI>>,stake_amount: option::Option<u64>,validator_address: address,ctx: &mut TxContext,) {letbalance = extract_coin_balance(delegate_stakes, stake_amount, ctx);  validator_set::request_add_stake(&mut self.validators, validator_address, balance, option::none(), ctx);}
```

  * `request_add_stake_with_locked_coin` Add user stake to a validator's staking pool using a locked SUI coin.

```

    
    
    publicfunrequest_add_stake_with_locked_coin(self: &mut SuiSystemState,stake: LockedCoin<SUI>,validator_address: address,ctx: &mut TxContext,) {let (balance, lock) = locked_coin::into_balance(stake);  validator_set::request_add_stake(&mut self.validators, validator_address, balance, option::some(lock), ctx);}
```

  * `request_withdraw_stake` Withdraw some portion of a user stake from a validator's staking pool.

```

    
    
    publicfunrequest_withdraw_stake(self: &mut SuiSystemState,delegation: &mut Delegation,staked_sui: &mut StakedSui,principal_withdraw_amount: u64,ctx: &mut TxContext,) {  validator_set::request_withdraw_stake(    &mut self.validators,    delegation,    staked_sui,    principal_withdraw_amount,    ctx,  );}
```

# bridge-node-configuration
# Sui Bridge Validator Node Configuration

Running a Bridge Validator Node (Bridge Node) requires registering your node with the bridge committee. Correct configuration of your node ensures optimal performance and valid metrics data. Follow this topic to make sure your Bridge Node is set up properly.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To set up and run a Bridge Node, you need to install `sui` and `sui-bridge-cli`. You can install them using one of the following options:

```

    
    
    # install from tip of `main`$ cargo install --locked --git "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git" sui sui-bridge-cli# install with a commit sha$ cargo install --locked --git "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git" --rev {SHA} sui sui-bridge-cli
```

## Committee registration[​](#committee-registration "Direct link to Committee registration")

To join the network you must first register with the bridge validator committee.

### Prepare for metadata[​](#prepare-for-metadata "Direct link to Prepare for metadata")

The required metadata includes two things:

  * `BridgeAuthorityKey`, an ECDSA key to sign messages. Because this is a hot key that is kept in memory, it’s fine to use the following tool to generate one and write it to file.
  * A REST API URL where the Bridge Node listens to and serves requests. Example: `https://bridge.example-sui-validator.io:443`. Make sure the port is correct and the URL does not contain any invalid characters, like quotes for example.

To create a `BridgeAuthorityKey`, run

```

    
    
    $ sui-bridge-cli create-bridge-validator-key <PATH-TO-WRITE>
```

where `<PATH-TO-WRITE>` is the location to write the key pair to.

info

It's highly recommended you create a new key pair in a secure environment (for example, in the same machine where your node runs) to avoid key compromise.

### Registration[​](#registration "Direct link to Registration")

After you have both authority key file and REST API URL ready, you can register them by using Sui CLI:

```

    
    
    $ sui validator register-bridge-committee --bridge-authority-key-path <BRIDGE-AUTHORITY-KEY-PATH> --bridge-authority-url <BRIDGE-AUTHORITY-URL>
```

#### Offline signing[​](#offline-signing "Direct link to Offline signing")

If you keep your validator account key in cold storage or you want to perform offline signing, use flags `--print-only` and `--validator-address` (with the value for the validator address). This prints serialized unsigned transaction bytes, then you can use your preferred signing process to produce signed bytes.

Run the following command to execute it:

```

    
    
    $ sui client execute-signed-tx
```

#### Update metadata (before committee is finalized)[​](#update-metadata-before-committee-is-finalized "Direct link to Update metadata \(before committee is finalized\)")

Both key and URL are changeable **before the committee is finalized**. If you wish to update metadata, simply rerun `sui validator register-bridge-committee`.

#### View registered metadata[​](#view-registered-metadata "Direct link to View registered metadata")

To double check you registered the correct metadata on chain, run

```

    
    
    $ sui-bridge-cli view-bridge-registration --sui-rpc-url {SUI-FULLNODE-URL}
```

## Update metadata (after committee is finalized)[​](#update-metadata-after-committee-is-finalized "Direct link to Update metadata \(after committee is finalized\)")

Use the following command to update bridge node URL:

```

    
    
    $ sui validator update-bridge-committee-node-url
```

Refer to [offline signing section](#offline-signing) in this page for how to sign the transaction offline.

Authoritiy key rotation is not supported yet.

## Bridge Node[​](#bridge-node "Direct link to Bridge Node")

You have several options when configuring your Bridge Node for performance and metrics monitoring. Follow the instructions that follow to configure your node for best results in your environment.

### Bridge Node hardware requirements[​](#bridge-node-hardware-requirements "Direct link to Bridge Node hardware requirements")

Suggested hardware requirements:

  * CPU: 6 physical cores
  * Memory: 16GB
  * Storage: 200GB
  * Network: 100Mbps

### WAF protection for Bridge Node[​](#waf-protection-for-bridge-node "Direct link to WAF protection for Bridge Node")

To protect against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and similar attacks intended to expend validator resources, you must provide rate limit protection for the bridge server.

In addition to protection, this gives node operators fine-grained control over the rate of requests they receive, and observability into those requests.

The currently recommended rate limit is `50 requests/second per unique IP`.

#### Web application firewall (WAF) options[​](#web-application-firewall-waf-options "Direct link to Web application firewall \(WAF\) options")

You can use a managed cloud service, for example:

It's also possible to use an open source load balancer, such as [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) for a practical, IP-based rate limit.

A shortened example HAProxy configuration looks like the following:

```

    
    
    frontend http-in  bind *:80  # Define an ACL to count requests per IP and block if over limit  acl too_many_requests src_http_req_rate() gt 50  # Track the request rate per IP  stick-table type ip size 1m expire 1m store http_req_rate(1s)  # Check request rate and deny if the limit is exceeded  http-request track-sc0 src  http-request deny if too_many_requests  default_backend bridgevalidatorbackend bridgevalidator  # Note the port needs to match the value in Bridge Node config, default is 9191  server bridgevalidator 0.0.0.0:9191
```

If choosing to use an open source load balancing option, make sure to set up metrics collection and alerting on the service.

### Bridge Node config[​](#bridge-node-config "Direct link to Bridge Node config")

Use `sui-bridge-cli` command to create a template. If you want to run `BridgeClient` (see the following section), pass `--run-client` as a parameter.

```

    
    
    $ sui-bridge-cli create-bridge-node-config-template {PATH}$ sui-bridge-cli create-bridge-node-config-template --run-client {PATH}
```

The generated configuration includes the following parameters:

Parameter| Description  
---|---  
`server-listen-port`| The port that Bridge Node listens to for handling requests.  
`metrics-port`| Port to export Prometheus metrics.  
`bridge-authority-key-path`| The path to the Bridge Validator key, generated from `sui-bridge-cli create-bridge-validator-key` command referenced previously.  
`run-client`| Whether Bridge Client should be enabled in Bridge Node (more instructions follow).  
`approved-governance-actions`| A list of governance actions that you want to support.  
`sui:sui-rpc-url`| Sui RPC URL.  
`sui:sui-bridge-chain-id`| `0` for Sui Mainnet, `1` for Sui Testnet.  
`eth:eth-rpc-url`| Ethereum RPC URL.  
`eth:eth-bridge-proxy-address`| The proxy address for Bridge Solidity contracts on Ethereum.  
`eth:eth-bridge-chain-id`| `10` for Ethereum Mainnet, `11` for Sepolia Testnet.  
`eth:eth-contracts-start-block-fallback`| The starting block BridgeNodes queries for from Ethereum FullNode. This number should be the block where Solidity contracts are deployed or slightly before.  
`metrics:push-url`| The url of the remote Sui metrics pipeline (for example, `https://metrics-proxy.[testnet_OR_mainnet].sui.io:8443/publish/metrics`). See the [metrics push section](#metrics-push) that follows for more details.  
  
With `run-client: true`, you can find these additional fields in the generated config:

Parameter| Description  
---|---  
`db-path`| Path of BridgeClient database, for BridgeClient.  
`sui:bridge-client-key-path`| The file path of Bridge Client key. This key can be generated with `sui-bridge-cli create-bridge-client-key` as previously shown. When `run-client` is true but you do not provide `sui:bridge-client-key-path`, it defaults to use the Bridge Validator key to submit transactions on Sui. This is not recommended for the sake of key separation.  
  
### Bridge Client[​](#bridge-client "Direct link to Bridge Client")

`BridgeClient` orchestrates bridge transfer requests. It is **optional** to run for a `BridgeNode`. `BridgeClient` submits transaction on the Sui network. Thus when it's enabled, you need a Sui account key with enough SUI balance.

To enable `bridge_client` feature on a `BridgeNode`, set the following parameters in `BridgeNodeConfig`:

```

    
    
    run-client:truedb-path: <PATH-TO-DB>sui:bridge-client-key-path: <PATH-TO-BRIDGE-CLIENT-KEY>
```

To create a `BridgeClient` key pair, run

```

    
    
    sui-bridge-cli create-bridge-client-key <PATH_TO_BRIDGE_CLIENT_KEY>
```

This prints the newly created Sui Address. Then we need to fund this address with some SUI for operations.

### Build Bridge Node[​](#build-bridge-node "Direct link to Build Bridge Node")

Build or install Bridge Node in one of the following ways:

  * Use `cargo install`. 

```

    
        $ cargo install --locked --git "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git" --branch {BRANCH-NAME} sui-bridge# OR$ cargo install --locked --git "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git" --rev {SHA-NAME} sui-bridge
```

  * Compile from source code 

```

    
        $ git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git$ cd sui$ git fetch origin {BRANCH-NAME|SHA}$ git checkout {BRANCH-NAME|SHA}$ cargo build --release --bin sui-bridge
```

  * Use `curl`/`wget` pre-built binaries (for Linux/AMD64 only). 

```

    
        curl https://sui-releases.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/{SHA}/sui-bridge -o sui-bridge
```

  * Use pre-built Docker image. Pull from Docker Hub: `mysten/sui-tools:{SHA}`

### Run Bridge Node[​](#run-bridge-node "Direct link to Run Bridge Node")

Running Bridge Node is similar to running a Sui node using systemd or Ansible. The command to start the Bridge Node is:

```

    
    
    $ RUST_LOG=info,sui_bridge=debug sui-bridge --config-path {BRIDGE-NODE-CONFIG-PATH}
```

### Ingress[​](#ingress "Direct link to Ingress")

Bridge Node listens for TCP connections over port `9191` (or the preferred port in the configuration file). You must allow incoming connections for that port on the host that is running Bridge Node.

Test ingress with `curl` on a remote machine and expect a `200` response:

```

    
    
    $ curl -v {YOUR_BRIDGE_URL}
```

### Bridge Node monitoring[​](#bridge-node-monitoring "Direct link to Bridge Node monitoring")

Use `uptime` to check if the node is running.

You can find a full list of Bridge Node metrics and their descriptions in the [`sui-bridge` crate](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-bridge/src/metrics.rs).

#### When `run-client: false`[​](#when-run-client-false "Direct link to when-run-client-false")

In this case Bridge Node runs as a passive observer and does not proactively poll on-chain activities. Important metrics to monitor in this case are the request handling metrics, such as:

  * `bridge_requests_received`
  * `bridge_requests_ok`
  * `bridge_err_requests`
  * `bridge_requests_inflight`
  * `bridge_eth_rpc_queries`
  * `bridge_eth_rpc_queries_latency`
  * `bridge_signer_with_cache_hit`
  * `bridge_signer_with_cache_miss`
  * `bridge_sui_rpc_errors`

#### When `run-client: true`[​](#when-run-client-true "Direct link to when-run-client-true")

In this case, Bridge Client is toggled on and syncs with blockchains proactively. The best metrics to track progress are:

  * `bridge_last_synced_sui_checkpoints`
  * `bridge_last_synced_eth_blocks`
  * `bridge_last_finalized_eth_block`
  * `bridge_sui_watcher_received_events`
  * `bridge_eth_watcher_received_events`
  * `bridge_sui_watcher_received_actions`
  * `bridge_eth_watcher_received_actions`

`bridge_gas_coin_balance` is also a critical metric to track the balance of your client gas coin, and top up after it dips below a certain threshold.

### Metrics push[​](#metrics-push "Direct link to Metrics push")

The Bridge Nodes can push metrics to the remote proxy for network-level observability.

To enable metrics push, set the following parameters in `BridgeNodeConfig`:

```

    
    
    metrics:push-url: https://metrics-proxy.[testnet|mainnet].sui.io:8443/publish/metrics
```

The proxy authenticates pushed metrics by using the metrics key pair. It is similar to `sui-node` pushing metrics with `NetworkKey`. Unlike `NetworkKey`, the Bridge Node metrics key is not recorded on chain and can be ephemeral. The metrics key is loaded from the `metrics-key-pair` field in `BridgeNodeConfig` if provided, otherwise a new key pair is generated on the fly. The proxy queries node public keys periodically by hitting the metrics public API key of each node.

When Bridge Node starts, it might log this line once:

```

    
    
    unable to push metrics: error sending request for url (xyz); new client will be created
```

This is okay to ignore as long as it does not persist. Otherwise, try:

```

    
    
    $ curl -i {your-bridge-node-url-onchain}/metrics_pub_key
```

and make sure the public key is correctly returned.

# validator-tasks
# Validator Tasks

This guide focuses on running the Sui node software as a validator.

## Requirements[​](#requirements "Direct link to Requirements")

To run a Sui Validator a machine with the following is required:

  * CPU: 24 physical cores (or 48 virtual cores)
  * Memory: 128 GB
  * Storage: 4 TB NVME
  * Network: 1 Gbps

## Deployment[​](#deployment "Direct link to Deployment")

You can deploy Sui node in a number of ways.

There are pre-built container images available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mysten/sui-node/tags).

And pre built `linux/amd64` binaries available in S3 that you can can fetch using one of the following methods:

```

    
    
    wget https://releases.sui.io/$SUI_SHA/sui-node
```

```

    
    
    curl https://releases.sui.io/$SUI_SHA/sui-node -o sui-node
```

To build directly from source:

```

    
    
    git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git && cd suigit checkout [SHA|BRANCH|TAG]cargo build --release --bin sui-node
```

Configuration and guides are available for the following deployment options:

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

Sui node runs with a single configuration file provided as an argument, example:

`./sui-node --config-path /opt/sui/config/validator.yaml`.

See [Validator](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/nre/config/validator.yaml) for configuration templates.

## Connectivity[​](#connectivity "Direct link to Connectivity")

Sui node uses the following ports by default:

protocol/port| reachability| purpose  
---|---|---  
TCP/8080| inbound| validator/transaction interface  
TCP/8081| inbound/outbound| consensus interface  
UDP/8084| inbound/outbound| peer to peer state sync interface  
TCP/8443| outbound| metrics pushing  
TCP/9184| localhost| metrics scraping  
  
To run a validator successfully, it is critical that ports 8080-8084 are open as outlined, including the specific protocol (TCP/UDP).

## Network Buffer[​](#network-buffer "Direct link to Network Buffer")

From load testing Sui validator networks, it has been determined that the default Linux network buffer sizes are too small. We recommend increasing them using one of the following two methods:

### Option 1: With /etc/sysctl.d/[​](#option-1-with-etcsysctld "Direct link to Option 1: With /etc/sysctl.d/")

These settings can be added to a new sysctl file specifically for the sui-node, or appended to an existing file. Modifications made in this way will persist across system restarts.

```

    
    
    # Create a new sysctl file for the sui-nodesudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/100-sui-node.conf# Add these lines to the file, overwriting existing settings if necessary.net.core.rmem_max = 104857600net.core.wmem_max = 104857600net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 8192 262144 104857600net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 8192 262144 104857600# Apply the settings immediately, before the next restartsudo sysctl --system
```

### Option 2: With sysctl command[​](#option-2-with-sysctl-command "Direct link to Option 2: With sysctl command")

These modifications do not persist across system restarts. Therefore, the commands should be run each time the host restarts.

```

    
    
    sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=104857600sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=104857600sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="8192 262144 104857600"sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="8192 262144 104857600"
```

### Verification[​](#verification "Direct link to Verification")

To verify that the system settings have indeed been updated, check the output of the following command:

```

    
    
    sudo sysctl -a | egrep [rw]mem
```

## Storage[​](#storage "Direct link to Storage")

All Sui node related data is stored by default under `/opt/sui/db/`. This is controlled in the Sui node configuration file.

```

    
    
    $ cat /opt/sui/config/validator.yaml | grep db-path db-path: /opt/sui/db/authorities_db db-path: /opt/sui/db/consensus_db
```

Ensure that you have an appropriately sized disk mounted for the database to write to.

  * To check the size of the local Sui node databases:

```

    
    
    du -sh /opt/sui/db/du -sh /opt/sui/db/authorities_dbdu -sh /opt/sui/db/consensus_db
```

  * To delete the local Sui node databases:

```

    
    
    sudo systemctl stop sui-nodesudo rm -rf /opt/sui/db/authorities_db /opt/sui/db/consensus_db
```

## Key management[​](#key-management "Direct link to Key management")

The following keys are used by Sui node:

key| scheme| purpose  
---|---|---  
protocol.key| bls12381| transactions  
account.key| ed25519| controls assets for staking  
network.key| ed25519| state sync  
worker.key| ed25519| consensus (to be migrated)  
  
These are configured in the [Sui node configuration file](#configuration).

## Monitoring[​](#monitoring "Direct link to Monitoring")

### Metrics[​](#metrics "Direct link to Metrics")

Sui node exposes metrics via a local HTTP interface. These can be scraped for use in a central monitoring system as well as viewed directly from the node.

  * View all metrics:

```

    
    
    curl -s http://localhost:9184/metrics
```

  * Search for a particular metric:

```

    
    
    curl http://localhost:9184/metrics | grep <METRIC>
```

Sui node also pushes metrics to a central Sui metrics proxy.

### Logs[​](#logs "Direct link to Logs")

Logs are controlled using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.

The `RUST_LOG_JSON=1` environment variable can optionally be set to enable logging in JSON structured format.

Depending on your deployment method, these are configured in the following places:

To view and follow the Sui node logs:

```

    
    
    journalctl -u sui-node -f
```

To search for a particular match

```

    
    
    journalctl -u sui-node -g <SEARCH_TERM>
```

  * If using Docker Compose, look at the examples in the [README](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/nre/docker/README.md#logs).

It is possible to change the logging configuration while a node is running using the admin interface.

To view the currently configured logging values:

```

    
    
    curl localhost:1337/logging
```

To change the currently configured logging values:

```

    
    
    curl localhost:1337/logging -d "info"
```

### Dashboards[​](#dashboards "Direct link to Dashboards")

Public dashboard for network wide visibility:

## Software updates[​](#software-updates "Direct link to Software updates")

When an update is required to the Sui node software the following process can be used. Follow the relevant Systemd or Docker Compose runbook depending on your deployment type. It is highly unlikely that you will want to restart with a clean database.

## State sync[​](#state-sync "Direct link to State sync")

Checkpoints in Sui contain the permanent history of the network. They are comparable to blocks in other blockchains with one big difference being that they are lagging instead of leading. All transactions are final and executed prior to being included in a checkpoint.

These checkpoints are synchronized between validators and fullnodes via a dedicated peer to peer state sync interface.

Inter-validator state sync is always permitted however there are controls available to limit what fullnodes are allowed to sync from a specific validator.

The default and recommended `max-concurrent-connections: 0` configuration does not affect inter-validator state sync, but will restrict all fullnodes from syncing. The Sui node [configuration](#configuration) can be modified to allow a known fullnode to sync from a validator:

```

    
    
    p2p-config: anemo-config:  max-concurrent-connections: 0 seed-peers:  - address: <multiaddr> # The p2p address of the fullnode   peer-id: <peer-id>  # hex encoded network public key of the node  - address: ...     # another permitted peer   peer-id: ...
```

## Chain operations[​](#chain-operations "Direct link to Chain operations")

The following chain operations are executed using the `sui` CLI. This binary is built and provided as a release similar to `sui-node`, examples:

```

    
    
    wget https://releases.sui.io/$SUI_SHA/suichmod +x sui
```

```

    
    
    curl https://releases.sui.io/$SUI_SHA/sui -o suichmod +x sui
```

It is recommended and often required that the `sui` binary release/version matches that of the deployed network.

### Updating on-chain metadata[​](#updating-on-chain-metadata "Direct link to Updating on-chain metadata")

You can leverage [Validator Tool](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/nre/validator_tool.md) to perform majority of the following tasks.

An active/pending validator can update its on-chain metadata by submitting a transaction. Some metadata changes take effect immediately, including:

  * name
  * description
  * image url
  * project url

Other metadata (keys, addresses, and so on) only come into effect at the next epoch.

To update metadata, a validator makes a MoveCall transaction that interacts with the System Object. For example:

  1. to update name to `new_validator_name`, use the Sui Client CLI to call `sui_system::update_validator_name`:

tip

Beginning with the Sui `v1.24.1` [release](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/mainnet-v1.24.1), the `--gas-budget` flag is no longer required for CLI commands.

```

    
    
    sui client call --package 0x3 --module sui_system --function update_validator_name --args 0x5 \"new_validator_name\" --gas-budget 10000
```

  1. to update p2p address starting from next epoch to `/ip4/192.168.1.1`, use the Sui Client CLI to call `sui_system::update_validator_next_epoch_p2p_address`:

```

    
    
    sui client call --package 0x3 --module sui_system --function update_validator_next_epoch_p2p_address --args 0x5 "[4, 192, 168, 1, 1]" --gas-budget 10000
```

See the [full list of metadata update functions here](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-system/sources/sui_system.move#L267-L444).

### Operation cap[​](#operation-cap "Direct link to Operation cap")

To avoid touching account keys too often and allowing them to be stored off-line, validators can delegate the operation ability to another address. This address can then update the reference gas price and tallying rule on behalf of the validator.

Upon creating a `Validator`, an `UnverifiedValidatorOperationCap` is created as well and transferred to the validator address. The holder of this `Cap` object (short for "Capability") therefore could perform operational actions for this validator. To authorize another address to conduct these operations, a validator transfers the object to another address that they control. The transfer can be done by using Sui Client CLI: `sui client transfer`.

To rotate the delegatee address or revoke the authorization, the current holder of `Cap` transfers it to another address. In the event of compromised or lost keys, the validator could create a new `Cap` object to invalidate the incumbent one. This is done by calling `sui_system::rotate_operation_cap`:

```

    
    
    sui client call --package 0x3 --module sui_system --function rotate_operation_cap --args 0x5 --gas-budget 10000
```

By default the new `Cap` object is transferred to the validator address, which then could be transferred to the new delegatee address. At this point, the old `Cap` becomes invalidated and no longer represents eligibility.

To get the current valid `Cap` object's ID of a validator, use the Sui Client CLI `sui client objects` command after setting the holder as the active address.

### Updating the gas price survey quote[​](#updating-the-gas-price-survey-quote "Direct link to Updating the gas price survey quote")

To update the gas price survey quote of a validator, which is used to calculate the reference gas price at the end of the epoch, the sender needs to hold a valid [`UnverifiedValidatorOperationCap`](#operation-cap). The sender could be the validator itself, or a trusted delegatee. To do so, call `sui_system::request_set_gas_price`:

```

    
    
    sui client call --package 0x3 --module sui_system --function request_set_gas_price --args 0x5 {cap_object_id} {new_gas_price} --gas-budget 10000
```

### Reporting/un-reporting validators[​](#reportingun-reporting-validators "Direct link to Reporting/un-reporting validators")

To report a validator or undo an existing reporting, the sender needs to hold a valid [`UnverifiedValidatorOperationCap`](#operation-cap). The sender could be the validator itself, or a trusted delegatee. To do so, call `sui_system::report_validator/undo_report_validator`:

```

    
    
    sui client call --package 0x3 --module sui_system --function report_validator/undo_report_validator --args 0x5 {cap_object_id} {reportee_address} --gas-budget 10000
```

After a validator is reported by `2f + 1` other validators by voting power, their staking rewards will be slashed.

### Joining the validator set[​](#joining-the-validator-set "Direct link to Joining the validator set")

In order for a Sui address to join the validator set, they need to first sign up as a validator candidate by calling `sui_system::request_add_validator_candidate` with their metadata and initial configs:

```

    
    
    sui client call --package 0x3 --module sui_system --function request_add_validator_candidate --args 0x5 {protocol_pubkey_bytes} {network_pubkey_bytes} {worker_pubkey_bytes} {proof_of_possession} {name} {description} {image_url} {project_url} {net_address} {p2p_address} {primary_address} {worker_address} {gas_price} {commission_rate} --gas-budget 10000
```

After an address becomes a validator candidate, any address (including the candidate address itself) can start staking with the candidate's staking pool. Refer to our dedicated staking FAQ on how staking works. Once a candidate's staking pool has accumulated at least `sui_system::MIN_VALIDATOR_JOINING_STAKE` amount of stake, the candidate can call `sui_system::request_add_validator` to officially add themselves to next epoch's active validator set:

```

    
    
    sui client call --package 0x3 --module sui_system --function request_add_validator --args 0x5 --gas-budget 10000000
```

### Leaving the validator set[​](#leaving-the-validator-set "Direct link to Leaving the validator set")

To leave the validator set starting next epoch, the sender needs to be an active validator in the current epoch and should call `sui_system::request_remove_validator`:

```

    
    
    sui client call --package 0x3 --module sui_system --function request_remove_validator --args 0x5 --gas-budget 10000
```

After the validator is removed at the next epoch change, the staking pool will become inactive and stakes can only be withdrawn from an inactive pool.

## Private security fixes[​](#private-security-fixes "Direct link to Private security fixes")

There might be instances where urgent security fixes need to be rolled out before publicly announcing it's presence (issues affecting liveliness, invariants such as SUI supply, governance, and so on). To not be actively exploited, Mysten Labs will release signed security binaries incorporating such fixes with a delay in publishing the source code until a large percentage of our validators have patched the vulnerability.

This release process is different and we expect us to announce the directory for such binaries out of band. Our public key to verify these binaries would be stored [here](https://sui-private.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sui_security_release.pem)

There is also a script available that downloads all the necessary signed binaries and docker artifacts incorporating the security fixes.

Usage `./download_private.sh <directory-name>`

You can also download and verify specific binaries that may not be included by the above script using the `download_and_verify_private_binary.sh` script.

Usage: `./download_and_verify_private_binary.sh <directory-name> <binary-name>`

# sui-full-node#set-up-from-source
# Sui Full Node Configuration

info

These instructions are for advanced users. If you just need a local development environment, you should instead follow the instructions in [Create a Local Sui Network](/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network) to create a local Full node, validators, and faucet.

Sui Full nodes validate blockchain activities, including transactions, checkpoints, and epoch changes. Each Full node stores and services the queries for the blockchain state and history.

This role enables validators to focus on servicing and processing transactions. When a validator commits a new set of transactions (or a block of transactions), the validator pushes that block to all connected Full nodes that then service the queries from clients.

## Features[​](#features "Direct link to Features")

Sui Full nodes:

  * Track and verify the state of the blockchain, independently and locally.
  * Serve read requests from clients.

## State synchronization[​](#state-synchronization "Direct link to State synchronization")

Sui Full nodes sync with validators to receive new transactions on the network.

A transaction requires a few round trips to 2f+1 validators to form a transaction certificate (TxCert).

This synchronization process includes:

  1. Following 2f+1 validators and listening for newly committed transactions.
  2. Making sure that 2f+1 validators recognize the transaction and that it reaches finality.
  3. Executing the transaction locally and updating the local DB.

This synchronization process requires listening to at a minimum 2f+1 validators to ensure that a Full node has properly processed all new transactions. Sui will improve the synchronization process with the introduction of checkpoints and the ability to synchronize with other Full nodes.

## Architecture[​](#architecture "Direct link to Architecture")

A Sui Full node is essentially a read-only view of the network state. Unlike validator nodes, Full nodes cannot sign transactions, although they can validate the integrity of the chain by re-executing transactions that a quorum of validators previously committed.

Today, a Sui Full node maintains the full history of the chain.

Validator nodes store only the latest transactions on the frontier of the object graph (for example, transactions with >0 unspent output objects).

## Full node setup[​](#full-node-setup "Direct link to Full node setup")

Follow the instructions here to run your own Sui Full node. Sui Full nodes run using the `sui-node` binary.

### Hardware requirements[​](#hardware-requirements "Direct link to Hardware requirements")

Suggested minimum hardware to run a Sui Full node:

  * CPUs: 8 physical cores / 16 vCPUs
  * RAM: 128 GB
  * Storage (SSD): 4 TB NVMe drive

### Software requirements[​](#software-requirements "Direct link to Software requirements")

Sui recommends running Sui Full nodes on Linux. Sui supports the Ubuntu and Debian distributions. You can run a Sui Full node on macOS, but this is only recommended for development and not for production use.

Make sure to [update Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#updating-and-uninstalling).

Use the following command to install additional Linux dependencies.

```

    
    
    sudo apt-get update \&& sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \tzdata \libprotobuf-dev \ca-certificates \build-essential \libssl-dev \libclang-dev \libpq-dev \pkg-config \openssl \protobuf-compiler \git \clang \cmake
```

## Running a Full node[​](#running-a-full-node "Direct link to Running a Full node")

Instructions for building, installing, or downloading the `sui-node` binary are available at [Sui Install](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install). These install instructions are specific to the `sui` cli, but apply to the `sui-node` binary as well.

There are many ways to run a Sui Full node (bare metal, virtual machine, Kubernetes statefulset, and so on), and the solution that you choose depends on your specific needs as well as the infrastructure that you have available.

There are some specific considerations to keep in mind when running a Sui Full node that apply to all environments:

  * [Genesis](/guides/operator/genesis): You must download the genesis blob for the network that you want to connect to, and make it available to the `sui-node`.
  * [Data Storage](/guides/operator/data-management): Sui Full nodes _can_ require a significant amount of disk space to store the blockchain history. If you plan to use your Full node to serve RPC requests, you must also plan for the storage of index files, which requires a significant amount of disk space.
  * [Monitoring](/guides/operator/monitoring): Sui Full nodes expose metrics about the node's health and the state of the Sui network.
  * [Updates](/guides/operator/updates): Sui Full nodes must be updated to the latest version to remain in sync with the network.
  * [Archival Fallback](/guides/operator/archives): The archival fallback allows you to sync checkpoints from any point in the chain's history. The network `seed-peers` below only keep a few epochs of history.

### Using Docker Compose[​](#using-docker-compose "Direct link to Using Docker Compose")

There's a guide in the Sui repository on running a Full node via [Docker Compose](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/docker/fullnode#readme). This alone is not suitable for a production environment, but can be used to get a Full node up and running quickly on a virtual machine or local machine for development purposes. Refer to [Running a Full node](#running-a-full-node) for instructions relevant to production use cases.

### Setting up a Full node[​](#setting-up-a-full-node "Direct link to Setting up a Full node")

When you are ready to run `sui-node` in your production environment, you can set up your Full node by completing the following steps:

  1. Make a copy of the [Full node YAML template](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-config/data/fullnode-template.yaml): `cp crates/sui-config/data/fullnode-template.yaml fullnode.yaml`

  2. Download the genesis blob for the network to use:

     * [Devnet genesis blob](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/devnet/genesis.blob): `curl -fLJO https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/devnet/genesis.blob`
     * [Testnet genesis blob](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/testnet/genesis.blob): `curl -fLJO https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/testnet/genesis.blob`
     * [Mainnet genesis blob](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/mainnet/genesis.blob): `curl -fLJO https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/mainnet/genesis.blob`
  3. For Testnet or Mainnet: Edit the `fullnode.yaml` file to include peer nodes for state synchronization. Append the following to the end of the current configuration:

     * Mainnet
     * Testnet

```

    
        p2p-config: seed-peers:  - address: /dns/mel-00.mainnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: d32b55bdf1737ec415df8c88b3bf91e194b59ee3127e3f38ea46fd88ba2e7849  - address: /dns/ewr-00.mainnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: c7bf6cb93ca8fdda655c47ebb85ace28e6931464564332bf63e27e90199c50ee  - address: /dns/ewr-01.mainnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: 3227f8a05f0faa1a197c075d31135a366a1c6f3d4872cb8af66c14dea3e0eb66  - address: /dns/lhr-00.mainnet.sui.io/udp/8084   peer-id: c619a5e0f8f36eac45118c1f8bda28f0f508e2839042781f1d4a9818043f732c  - address: /dns/sui-mainnet-ssfn-1.nodeinfra.com/udp/8084   peer-id: 0c52ca8d2b9f51be4a50eb44ace863c05aadc940a7bd15d4d3f498deb81d7fc6  - address: /dns/sui-mainnet-ssfn-2.nodeinfra.com/udp/8084   peer-id: 1dbc28c105aa7eb9d1d3ac07ae663ea638d91f2b99c076a52bbded296bd3ed5c  - address: /dns/sui-mainnet-ssfn-ashburn-na.overclock.run/udp/8084   peer-id: 5ff8461ab527a8f241767b268c7aaf24d0312c7b923913dd3c11ee67ef181e45  - address: /dns/sui-mainnet-ssfn-dallas-na.overclock.run/udp/8084   peer-id: e1a4f40d66f1c89559a195352ba9ff84aec28abab1d3aa1c491901a252acefa6  - address: /dns/ssn01.mainnet.sui.rpcpool.com/udp/8084   peer-id: fadb7ccb0b7fc99223419176e707f5122fef4ea686eb8e80d1778588bf5a0bcd  - address: /dns/ssn02.mainnet.sui.rpcpool.com/udp/8084   peer-id: 13783584a90025b87d4604f1991252221e5fd88cab40001642f4b00111ae9b7e

  4. Optional: Set up the [Archival Fallback](/guides/operator/archives), which allows you to sync checkpoints if you fall behind the network's `seed-peers`.

  5. Optional: Skip this step to accept the default paths to resources. Edit the fullnode.yaml file to use custom paths.

  6. Update the `db-path` field with the path to the Full node database. `db-path: "/db-files/sui-fullnode"`

  7. Update the `genesis-file-location` with the path to genesis.blob.

```

    
        genesis:  genesis-file-location: "/sui-fullnode/genesis.blob"
```

### Starting your Full node[​](#starting-a-full-node "Direct link to Starting your Full node")

You should not start syncing your Full node from the start of the genesis. This will take a very long time and consume a lot of resources (including likely filling up your disk).

Instead, start your Full node from a recent snapshot. You can find details on how to obtain a snapshot from the [Sui Snapshots guide](/guides/operator/snapshots).

Now that you have your Full node config file set up, and you've obtained a snapshot, you can start your Full node by running the `sui-node` binary with your `fullnode.yaml` configuration file:

```

    
    
    sui-node --config-path fullnode.yaml
```

It's a good idea to use something like systemd to manage your Full node in a production environment.

### Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

If you receive a `cannot find -lpq` error, you are missing the `libpq` library. Use `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev` to install on Linux, or `brew install libpq` on MacOS. After you install on MacOS, create a Homebrew link using `brew link --force libpq`. For further context, reference the [issue on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70313347/ld-library-not-found-for-lpq-when-build-rust-in-macos?rq=1).

If you receive the following error:

```

    
    
    panicked at error binding to 0.0.0.0:9184: error creating server listener: Address already in use (os error 98)
```

Then update the metrics address in your fullnode.yaml file to use port `9180`.

```

    
    
    metrics-address: "0.0.0.0:9180"
```

# sui-api
# Sui RPC

info

The Sui RPC is upgrading from JSON-RPC to GraphQL. See [GraphQL for Sui RPC](/concepts/graphql-rpc) for more information.

_SuiJSON_ is a JSON-based format with restrictions that allow Sui to align JSON inputs more closely with Move call arguments.

This table shows the restrictions placed on JSON types to make them SuiJSON compatible:

JSON| SuiJSON Restrictions| Move Type Mapping  
---|---|---  
Number| Must be unsigned integer| u8, u6, u32, u64 (encoded as String), u128 (encoded as String), u256 (encoded as String)  
String| No restrictions| Vector`<u8>`, Address, ObjectID, TypeTag, Identifier, Unsigned integer (256 bit max)  
Boolean| No restrictions| Bool  
Array| Must be homogeneous JSON and of SuiJSON type| Vector  
Null| Not allowed| N/A  
Object| Not allowed| N/A  
  
## Type coercion reasoning[​](#type-coercion-reasoning "Direct link to Type coercion reasoning")

Due to the loosely typed nature of JSON/SuiJSON and the strongly typed nature of Move types, you sometimes need to overload SuiJSON types to represent multiple Move types.

For example `SuiJSON::Number` can represent both _u8_ and _u32_. This means you have to coerce and sometimes convert types.

Which type you coerce depends on the expected Move type. For example, if the Move function expects a u8, you must have received a `SuiJSON::Number` with a value less than 256. More importantly, you have no way to easily express Move addresses in JSON, so you encode them as hex strings prefixed by `0x`.

Additionally, Move supports u128 and u256 but JSON doesn't. As a result Sui allows encoding numbers as strings.

## Type coercion rules[​](#type-coercion-rules "Direct link to Type coercion rules")

Move Type| SuiJSON Representations| Valid Examples| Invalid Examples  
---|---|---|---  
Bool| Bool| true, false  
u8| Supports 3 formats: Unsigned number < 256. Decimal string with value < 256. One byte hex string prefixed with 0x.| 7 "70" "0x43"| -5: negative not allowed 3.9: float not allowed NaN: not allowed 300: U8 must be less than 256 " 9": Spaces not allowed in string "9A": Hex num must be prefixed with 0x "0x09CD": Too large for U8  
u16| Three formats are supported Unsigned number < 65536. Decimal string with value < 65536. Two byte hex string prefixed with 0x.| 712 "570" "0x423"| -5: negative not allowed 3.9: float not allowed NaN: not allowed 98342300: U16 must be less than 65536 " 19": Spaces not allowed in string "9EA": Hex num must be prefixed with 0x "0x049C1D": Too large for U16  
u32| Three formats are supported Unsigned number < 4294967296. Decimal string with value < 4294967296. One byte hex string prefixed with 0x.| 9823247 "987120" "0x4BADE93"| -5: negative not allowed 3.9: float not allowed NaN: not allowed 123456789123456: U32 must be less than 4294967296 " 9": Spaces not allowed in string "9A": Hex num must be prefixed with 0x "0x3FF1FF9FFDEFF": Too large for U32  
u64| Supports two formats Decimal string with value < U64::MAX. Up to 8 byte hex string prefixed with 0x.| "747944370" "0x2B1A39A15E"| 123434: Although this is a valid U64 number, it must be encoded as a string  
u128| Two formats are supported Decimal string with value < U128::MAX. Up to 16 byte hex string prefixed with 0x.| "74794734937420002470" "0x2B1A39A1514E1D8A7CE"| 34: Although this is a valid U128 number, it must be encoded as a string  
u256| Two formats are supported Decimal string with value < U256::MAX. Up to 32 byte hex string prefixed with 0x.| "747947349374200024707479473493742000247" "0x2B1762FECADA39753FCAB2A1514E1D8A7CE"| 123434: Although this is a valid U256 number, it must be encoded as a string 0xbc33e6e4818f9f2ef77d020b35c24be738213e64d9e58839ee7b4222029610de  
Address| 32 byte hex string prefixed with 0x| "0xbc33e6e4818f9f2ef77d020b35c24be738213e64d9e58839ee7b4222029610de"| 0xbc33: string too short bc33e6e4818f9f2ef77d020b35c24be738213e64d9e58839ee7b4222029610de: missing 0x prefix 0xG2B1A39A1514E1D8A7CE45919CFEB4FEE70B4E01: invalid hex char G

Vector`<Move Type>`| Homogeneous vector of aforementioned types including nested vectors of primitive types (only "flat" vectors of ObjectIDs are allowed)| [1,2,3,4]: simple U8 vector [[3,600],[],[0,7,4]]: nested U32 vector ["0x2B1A39A1514E1D8A7CE45919CFEB4FEE", "0x2B1A39A1514E1D8A7CE45919CFEB4FEF"]: ObjectID vector| [1,2,3,false]: not homogeneous JSON [1,2,null,4]: invalid elements [1,2,"7"]: although Sui allows encoding numbers as strings meaning this array can evaluate to [1,2,7], the array is still ambiguous so it fails the homogeneity check.  
Vector`<u8>`| For convenience, Sui allows: U8 vectors represented as UTF-8 (and ASCII) strings.| "√®ˆbo72 √∂†∆˚–œ∑π2ie": UTF-8 "abcdE738-2 _=?": ASCII

# sui-graphql
# GraphQL for Sui RPC (Beta)

⚙️Beta Feature

This content describes a beta feature or service. Beta features and services are in active development, so details are likely to change.

This feature or service is currently available in

  * Devnet
  * Testnet
  * Mainnet

GraphQL for the Sui RPC is a public service that enables interacting with the Sui [network](https://sui.io/networkinfo).

To get started with GraphQL for the Sui RPC, check out the [Getting Started](/guides/developer/getting-started/graphql-rpc) guide. If you'd like to learn more about the concepts used in the GraphQL service, check out the [GraphQL](/concepts/graphql-rpc) for Sui RPC concepts page.

## Key Types[​](#key-types "Direct link to Key Types")

All GraphQL API elements are accessible via the left sidebar, the following are good starting points to explore from.

  * "Queries" lists all top-level queries for reading the chain state, from reading details about addresses and objects to [dryRunTransactionBlock](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/api/queries/dry-run-transaction-block), which has an execution-like interface but does not modify the chain.
  * "Mutations" lists operations that can modify chain state, like [executeTransactionBlock](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/api/mutations/execute-transaction-block).
  * [Object](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/object) is the type representing all on-chain objects (Move values and packages).
  * [Address](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/address) corresponds to account addresses (derived from the public keys of signatures that sign transactions) and can be used to query the objects owned by these accounts and the transactions they have signed or been affected by.
  * [Owner](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/owner) represents any entity that can own a [MoveObject](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/move-object) to handle cases where it is not known whether the owner is an [Object](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/object) or an [Address](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/address) (for example, from the perspective of a Move object looking at its owner).

## Related links[​](#related-links "Direct link to Related links")

  * [GraphQL migration](/guides/developer/advanced/graphql-migration): Migrating to GraphQL guides you through migrating Sui RPC projects from JSON-RPC to GraphQL.
  * [GraphQL quick-start](/guides/developer/getting-started/graphql-rpc): Querying Sui RPC with GraphQL gets you started using GraphQL to query the Sui RPC for on-chain data.
  * [GraphQL concepts](/concepts/graphql-rpc): GraphQL for Sui RPC examines the elements of GraphQL that you should know to get the most from the service.

# execute-transaction-block
# executeTransactionBlock

Execute a transaction, committing its effects on chain.

  * `txBytes` is a `TransactionData` struct that has been BCS-encoded and then Base64-encoded.
  * `signatures` are a list of `flag || signature || pubkey` bytes, Base64-encoded.

Waits until the transaction has reached finality on chain to return its transaction digest, or returns the error that prevented finality if that was not possible. A transaction is final when its effects are guaranteed on chain (it cannot be revoked).

There may be a delay between transaction finality and when GraphQL requests (including the request that issued the transaction) reflect its effects. As a result, queries that depend on indexing the state of the chain (e.g. contents of output objects, address-level balance information at the time of the transaction), must wait for indexing to catch up by polling for the transaction digest using `Query.transactionBlock`.

### suix_getOwnedObjects

Return the list of objects owned by an address. Note that if the address owns more than `QUERY_MAX_RESULT_LIMIT` objects, the pagination is not accurate, because previous page may have been updated when the next page is fetched. Please use suix_queryObjects if this is a concern.

Parameters

Name<Type>

Required

Description

address< SuiAddress >

Yes

The owner's Sui address

query< ObjectResponseQuery >

No

The objects query criteria.

cursor< ObjectID >

No

An optional paging cursor. If provided, the query will start from the next item after the specified cursor. Default to start from the first item if not specified.

limit< uint >

No

Max number of items returned per page, default to [QUERY_MAX_RESULT_LIMIT] if not specified.

Result

ObjectsPage< Page_for_SuiObjectResponse_and_ObjectID >

`next_cursor` points to the last item in the page; Reading with `next_cursor` will start from the next item after `next_cursor` if `next_cursor` is `Some`, otherwise it will start from the first item.

Parameter

Required

Description

data<[ SuiObjectResponse ]>

Yes

hasNextPage< Boolean >

Yes

nextCursor< ObjectID | null >

No

Example

Returns all the objects the address provided in the request owns and that match the filter. By default, only the digest value is returned, but the request returns additional information by setting the relevant keys to true. A cursor value is also provided, so the list of results begin after that value.

### sui_executeTransactionBlock

Execute the transaction and wait for results if desired. Request types: 1. WaitForEffectsCert: waits for TransactionEffectsCert and then return to client. This mode is a proxy for transaction finality. 2. WaitForLocalExecution: waits for TransactionEffectsCert and make sure the node executed the transaction locally before returning the client. The local execution makes sure this node is aware of this transaction when client fires subsequent queries. However if the node fails to execute the transaction locally in a timely manner, a bool type in the response is set to false to indicated the case. request_type is default to be `WaitForEffectsCert` unless options.show_events or options.show_effects is true

Parameters

Name<Type>

Required

Description

tx_bytes< Base64 >

Yes

BCS serialized transaction data bytes without its type tag, as base-64 encoded string.

signatures<[ Base64 ]>

Yes

A list of signatures (`flag || signature || pubkey` bytes, as base-64 encoded string). Signature is committed to the intent message of the transaction data, as base-64 encoded string.

options< TransactionBlockResponseOptions >

No

Options for specifying the content to be returned

request_type< ExecuteTransactionRequestType >

No

The request type, derived from `SuiTransactionBlockResponseOptions` if None

Result

SuiTransactionBlockResponse< TransactionBlockResponse >

Parameter

Required

Description

balanceChanges< BalanceChange [array,null] >

No

checkpoint< BigInt_for_uint64 | null >

No

The checkpoint number when this transaction was included and hence finalized. This is only returned in the read api, not in the transaction execution api.

confirmedLocalExecution< [boolean,null] >

No

digest< TransactionDigest >

Yes

effects< TransactionBlockEffects | null >

No

errors<[ string ]>

No

events< Event [array,null] >

No

objectChanges< ObjectChange [array,null] >

rawEffects<[ string ]>

No

rawTransaction< Base64 >

No

BCS encoded [SenderSignedData] that includes input object references returns empty array if `show_raw_transaction` is false

timestampMs< BigInt_for_uint64 | null >

No

transaction< TransactionBlock | null >

No

Transaction input data

Example

Executes a transaction with serialized signatures.

## GasCostSummary

Summary of the charges in a transaction. Storage is charged independently of computation. There are 3 parts to the storage charges: `storage_cost`: it is the charge of storage at the time the transaction is executed. The cost of storage is the number of bytes of the objects being mutated multiplied by a variable storage cost per byte `storage_rebate`: this is the amount a user gets back when manipulating an object. The `storage_rebate` is the `storage_cost` for an object minus fees. `non_refundable_storage_fee`: not all the value of the object storage cost is given back to user and there is a small fraction that is kept by the system. This value tracks that charge.

When looking at a gas cost summary the amount charged to the user is `computation_cost + storage_cost - storage_rebate` and that is the amount that is deducted from the gas coins. `non_refundable_storage_fee` is collected from the objects being mutated/deleted and it is tracked by the system in storage funds.

Objects deleted, including the older versions of objects mutated, have the storage field on the objects added up to a pool of "potential rebate". This rebate then is reduced by the "nonrefundable rate" such that: `potential_rebate(storage cost of deleted/mutated objects) = storage_rebate + non_refundable_storage_fee`

# rpc-best-practices
# RPC Best Practices

This topic provides some best practices for configuring your RPC settings to ensure a reliable infrastructure for your projects and services built on Sui.

caution

Use dedicated nodes/shared services rather than public endpoints for production apps. The public endpoints maintained by Mysten Labs (`fullnode.<NETWORK>.sui.io:443`) are rate-limited, and support only 100 requests per 30 seconds. Do not use public endpoints in production applications with high traffic volume.

You can either run your own Full nodes, or outsource this to a professional infrastructure provider (preferred for apps that have high traffic). You can find a list of reliable RPC endpoint providers for Sui on the [Sui Dev Portal](https://sui.io/developers#dev-tools) using the **Node Service** tag.

## RPC provisioning guidance[​](#rpc-provisioning-guidance "Direct link to RPC provisioning guidance")

Consider the following when working with a provider:

  * **SLA and 24-hour support:** Choose a provider that offers a SLA that meets your needs and 24-hour support.
  * **Onboarding call:** Always do an onboarding call with the provider you select to ensure they can provide service that meets your needs. If you have a high-traffic event, such as an NFT mint coming up, notify your RPC provider with the expected traffic increase at least 48 hours in advance.
  * **Redundancy:** It is important for high-traffic and time-sensitive apps, like NFT marketplaces and DeFi protocols, to ensure they don't rely on just one provider for RPCs. Many projects default to just using a single provider, but that's extremely risky and you should use other providers to provide redundancy.
  * **Traffic estimate:** You should have a good idea about the amount and type of traffic you expect, and you should communicate that information in advance with your RPC provider. During high-traffic events (such as NFT mints), request increased capacity from your RPC provider in advance. Bot mitigation - As Sui matures, a lot of bots will emerge on the network. Sui dApp builders should think about bot mitigation at the infrastructure level. This depends heavily on use cases. For NFT minting, bots are undesirable. However, for certain DeFi use cases, bots are necessary. Think about the implications and prepare your infrastructure accordingly.
  * **Provisioning notice:** Make RPC provisioning requests at least one week in advance. This gives operators and providers advance notice so they can arrange for the configure hardware/servers as necessary. If there’s a sudden, unexpected demand, please reach out to us so we can help set you up with providers that have capacity for urgent situations.

# cli
# Sui CLI

Sui provides a command line interface (CLI) tool to interact with the Sui network, its features, and the Move programming language. The complete suite of tools is called the Sui CLI, with commands grouped together by feature. Each group of commands is commonly referred to by its top-level command: Sui Client CLI, Sui Console CLI, Sui Keytool CLI, Sui Move CLI, and Sui Validator CLI.

## Check Sui CLI installation[​](#check-sui-cli-installation "Direct link to Check Sui CLI installation")

Before you can use the Sui CLI, you must install it. To check if the CLI exists on your system, open a terminal or console and type the following command:

```

    
    
    sui --version
```

If the terminal or console responds with a version number, you already have the Sui CLI installed.

If the command is not found, follow the instructions in [Install Sui](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) to get the Sui CLI on your system.

## Update CLI[​](#update-cli "Direct link to Update CLI")

To get the latest version of the CLI, you can run the following command from a terminal or console. Be sure to replace `<BRANCH-NAME>` with `main`, `devnet`, `testnet`, or `mainnet` to get the desired version. For more information on the branches available, see [Sui Environment Setup](/references/contribute/sui-environment).

```

    
    
    cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch <BRANCH-NAME> --features tracing sui
```

info

The `--features tracing` flag is necessary only if you want to run gas profiles for transactions.

## Sui CLI commands[​](#sui-cli-commands "Direct link to Sui CLI commands")

There are a number of top-level commands available, but the five most useful to users are the following. Use the `help` flag for the commands that are not documented yet. For example, `sui validator --help`.

  * **[Sui Client CLI](/references/cli/client):** Use the `sui client` commands to interact with the Sui network.
  * **[Sui Client PTB CLI](/references/cli/ptb):** Use the `sui client ptb` command to build and execute PTBs.
  * **[Sui Console CLI](/references/cli/console):** Use `sui console` to open an interactive console with the currently active network.
  * **[Sui Keytool CLI](/references/cli/keytool):** Use the `sui keytool` commands to access cryptography utilities.
  * **[Sui Move CLI](/references/cli/move):** Use the `sui move` commands to work with the Move programming language.
  * **[Sui Validator CLI](/references/cli/validator):** Use the `sui validator` commands to access tools useful for Sui validators.

# client
# Sui Client CLI

The Sui CLI `client` command provides command-level access to interact with the Sui network. Typical uses for `sui client` include publishing Move smart contracts, getting the information of an object, executing transactions, or managing addresses.

## Check Sui CLI installation[​](#check-sui-cli-installation "Direct link to Check Sui CLI installation")

Before you can use the Sui CLI, you must install it. To check if the CLI exists on your system, open a terminal or console and type the following command:

```

    
    
    sui --version
```

If the terminal or console responds with a version number, you already have the Sui CLI installed.

If the command is not found, follow the instructions in [Install Sui](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) to get the Sui CLI on your system.

## Commands[​](#commands "Direct link to Commands")

The following list itemizes all the available subcommands for the `sui client` command.

```

    
    
    Usage: sui client [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]Commands: active-address       Default address used for commands when none specified active-env         Default environment used for commands when none specified addresses          Obtain the Addresses managed by the client balance           List the coin balance of an address call            Call Move function chain-identifier      Query the chain identifier from the rpc endpoint dynamic-field        Query a dynamic field by its address envs            List all Sui environments execute-signed-tx      Execute a Signed Transaction. This is useful when the user prefers to sign elsewhere and use this command to execute execute-combined-signed-tx Execute a combined serialized SenderSignedData string faucet           Request gas coin from faucet. By default, it will use the active address and the active network gas             Obtain all gas objects owned by the address. An address' alias can be used instead of the address merge-coin         Merge two coin objects into one coin new-address         Generate new address and keypair with keypair scheme flag {ed25519 | secp256k1 | secp256r1} with optional derivation path, default to m/44'/784'/0'/0'/0' for ed25519 or m/54'/784'/0'/0/0                 for secp256k1 or m/74'/784'/0'/0/0 for secp256r1. Word length can be { word12 | word15 | word18 | word21 | word24} default to word12 if not specified new-env           Add new Sui environment object           Get object info objects           Obtain all objects owned by the address. It also accepts an address by its alias pay             Pay coins to recipients following specified amounts, with input coins. Length of recipients must be the same as that of amounts pay-all-sui         Pay all residual SUI coins to the recipient with input coins, after deducting the gas cost. The input coins also include the coin for gas payment, so no extra gas coin is required pay-sui           Pay SUI coins to recipients following following specified amounts, with input coins. Length of recipients must be the same as that of amounts. The input coins also include the coin for                 gas payment, so no extra gas coin is required publish           Publish Move modules split-coin         Split a coin object into multiple coins switch           Switch active address and network(e.g., devnet, local rpc server) tx-block          Get the effects of executing the given transaction block transfer          Transfer object transfer-sui        Transfer SUI, and pay gas with the same SUI coin object. If amount is specified, only the amount is transferred; otherwise the entire object is transferred upgrade           Upgrade Move modules verify-bytecode-meter    Run the bytecode verifier on the package verify-source        Verify local Move packages against on-chain packages, and optionally their dependencies profile-transaction     Profile the gas usage of a transaction. Unless an output filepath is not specified, outputs a file `gas_profile_{tx_digest}_{unix_timestamp}.json` which can be opened in a flamegraph                 tool such as speedscope replay-transaction     Replay a given transaction to view transaction effects. Set environment variable MOVE_VM_STEP=1 to debug replay-batch        Replay transactions listed in a file replay-checkpoint      Replay all transactions in a range of checkpoints help            Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)Options:   --client.config <CONFIG> Sets the file storing the state of our user accounts (an empty one will be created if missing)   --json          Return command outputs in json format -y, --yes -h, --help          Print help
```

## JSON output[​](#json-output "Direct link to JSON output")

Append the `--json` flag to commands to format responses in JSON instead of the more human-friendly default Sui CLI output. This can be useful for extremely large datasets, for example, as those results can have a troublesome display on smaller screens. In these cases, the `--json` flag is useful.

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

The following examples demonstrate some of the most often used commands.

### List available network environments[​](#list-available-network-environments "Direct link to List available network environments")

Use the `sui client envs` command to find the network environments set up in the CLI. The information for these environments is also stored in the client.yaml file in the Sui configuration directory (`~/.sui/sui_config`).

```

    
    
    ╭────────┬────────────────────────────────────┬────────╮│ alias │ url                │ active │├────────┼────────────────────────────────────┼────────┤│ devnet │ https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443 │ * 	  │╰────────┴────────────────────────────────────┴────────╯
```

### Create network environment[​](#create-network-environment "Direct link to Create network environment")

Use `client new-env` to add details for a new network environment. This example creates an environment pointer to Sui Mainnet. Setting the `alias` value makes referencing the environment less prone to typographical errors. After running this command, Sui updates your client.yaml file in `~/.sui/sui_config` with the new information.

```

    
    
    $ sui client new-env --alias=mainnet --rpc https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443Added new Sui env [mainnet] to config.
```

### Set current environment[​](#set-current-environment "Direct link to Set current environment")

Use the `sui client switch` command to change the current network. This example switches the current network to `mainnet`.

```

    
    
    $ sui client switch --env mainnetActive environment switched to [mainnet]
```

If you run `sui client envs` after this command, you see the asterisk in the `active` column on the `mainnet` row of the table.

### Get current active address[​](#get-current-active-address "Direct link to Get current active address")

Use the `sui client active-address` command to reveal the current address. The CLI uses the current active address to execute address-specific CLI commands (like `sui client objects`) when you don't provide them with a Sui address value.

```

    
    
    $ sui client active-address0x514692f08249c3e9951234ce29074695840422564bff85e424b56de462913e0d
```

### Request a SUI coin from faucet[​](#request-a-sui-coin-from-faucet "Direct link to Request a SUI coin from faucet")

If you use one of the standard public RPCs (for example, `fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443`), you can use the `faucet` command to request gas coins. If you use a custom faucet service, then pass in the URL to the faucet using the `--url` option.

```

    
    
    $ sui client faucetRequest successful. It can take up to 1 minute to get the coin. Run sui client gas to check your gas coins.
```

### Get objects owned by an address[​](#get-objects-owned-by-an-address "Direct link to Get objects owned by an address")

Use `sui client objects` to list summary information about the objects the current active address owns. You can provide a Sui address value to the command to list objects for a particular address. This example lists objects for the current active address.

```

    
    
    $ sui client objects 0x36df11369cf00ecf0be68d6ba965b0abe2e883bc5245911e3a29ebfa0aaf6b69╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮| ╭────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ ││ │ objectId  │ 0xfffbb30ccb631f15f6cd36700589fc9c31cb04af28a95f3ed26d62daf3acb57f │ ││ │ version	  │ 33363559                            	 │ ││ │ digest 	  │ IY7/qsIJhliQL0uxwSzNYu0SMcn5AMsqQklSGngn1V0=          	 │ ││ │ objectType │ 0x0000..0002::coin::Coin                    	 │ ││ ╰────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ ││ ╭────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ ││ │ objectId  │ 0xfffe59fb6f78b1ced7f6537e69a205cc45d105270857bfd66332f9a627a38ae0 │ ││ │ version	  │ 33370864                              │ ││ │ digest   │ b+tKChvujbCk/UCm8L+lflyb6Vjt7beB+uz6+ahUHmM=          	 │ ││ │ objectType │ 0x0000..0002::coin::Coin                    	 │ ││ ╰────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

### Get complete object information[​](#get-complete-object-information "Direct link to Get complete object information")

### Send SUI or objects[​](#send-sui-or-objects "Direct link to Send SUI or objects")

In this example, let's see how to transfer SUI or transfer an object from one address to another. First of all, there two main commands for sending SUI or transferring objects: `pay` and `transfer`. Both `pay` and `transfer` have a few sister commands: `pay-sui`, `pay-all-sui`, `transfer-sui`.

The differences between these commands are:

  * commands that end in `-sui` deal with Sui's native coin, and they use the input coints to pay for gas and for transferring SUI or the object.
  * `pay-` commands typically deal with coins and handle gas smashing for you, whereas `transfer` commands can handle the transfer of any object that has public transfer, meaning any object that has the `store` ability.
  * `pay` commands allow you to send coins to multiple recipients, whereas `transfer` commands only accept one recipient.
  * `pay-all-sui` is a special case of `pay-sui` that offers a way to transfer the entire balance after smashing.
  * `transfer-sui` is a legacy command and has been entirely superseded by `pay-sui` or `pay-all-sui` depending on whether an amount is specified or not.

Assume you have two addresses:

```

    
    
    ╭───────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────╮│ alias       │ address                              │ active address │├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────┤│ hungry-spodumene │ 0x0fe375fff0ee40d20c54a7f2478b9b5c7eaa3625b7611f9661ec5faefb4a6fea │ *       ││ eloquent-amber  │ 0x3d78abc33ccd173c521b4f9e78b21ea2c989960b631732c539efaa38bda30976 │        │╰───────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────╯
```

Address `hungry-spodumene` has a few coins:

```

```

You want to send 0.5 SUI to `eloquent-amber`. Given that you have a few gas coins, you can use `pay`. If only one gas coin exists, then you need to use `transfer-sui` or `pay-sui`, or you would need to split the coin first to have another coin to use for paying gas. In this case, let's use the `pay-sui` command as you do not need to provide a separate gas coin to be used for the gas fees. In the command below, you set the recipient to be `eloquent-amber`, which coin to use to transfer SUI from, and the amount of SUI to transfer.

tip

Beginning with the Sui `v1.24.1` [release](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/mainnet-v1.24.1), the `--gas-budget` flag is no longer required for CLI commands.

```

    
    
    sui client pay-sui --recipients eloquent-amber --input-coins 0xc9b447fff18f13fa035e028534b8344d5fc8a8760248fad10155e78f44dc3a52 --amounts 500000000 --gas-budget 5000000
```

The result is:

```

Check the gas for the sender and the recipient's coins using `sui client gas <address>`. The sender now has 199.49 SUI for that gas coin that was used. 0.5 SUI was transferred, and the remaining 0.01 SUI paid the gas fees.

```

If you want to transfer the whole object, you can use `sui client pay-all-sui` or `sui client transfer-sui` (without passing the amount):

```

    
    
    sui client pay-sui --recipient eloquent-amber --input-coins 0xc9b447fff18f13fa035e028534b8344d5fc8a8760248fad10155e78f44dc3a52 --gas-budget 5000000orsui client transfer-sui --to eloquent-amber --sui-coin-object-id 0xc9b447fff18f13fa035e028534b8344d5fc8a8760248fad10155e78f44dc3a52 --gas-budget 5000000
```

Then check the gas for `eloquent-amber` again:

```

### Replay a transaction[​](#replay-a-transaction "Direct link to Replay a transaction")

Use the `sui client replay-transaction --tx-digest <TRANSACTION-DIGEST>` to re-execute a transaction locally and show the transaction effects. This command will fetch the transaction dependencies from the fullnode specified in the client env. For transactions that happened quite far in the past, it is advised to set the client fullnode to one that has non-pruned chain data for that transaction. This will also verify that the resulting effects from the locally executed transaction match the effects of the transaction stored on-chain.

You can add additional flags `--gas-info` and `--ptb-info` to this command to see more information about the transaction.

```

```

Use `sui client replay-batch --path <FILEPATH>` to replay several transactions listed in a newline-separated file. This will verify that all transactions local execution results match the effects on-chain.

### Profile a transaction[​](#profile-a-transaction "Direct link to Profile a transaction")

Use the `sui client profile-transaction --tx-digest <TRANSACTION-DIGEST>` command to re-execute a transaction locally and produce a gas profile. Similar to the `replay` command, this command fetches the transaction dependencies from the Full node specified in the client environment that are needed to execute the transaction. During the local execution of the transaction, this command records all the Move function invocations and the gas cost breakdown for each invocation.

To enable the profiler, you must either install or build the Sui Client binary locally with the `--features tracing` flag.

```

    
    
    cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch <BRANCH-NAME> --features tracing sui
```

The command outputs a profile to the current working directory in the format `gas_profile_{tx_digest}_{unix_timestamp}.json`. You can include the optional flag `--profile-output </PATH/OUTPUT.json>` to write the profile to `/PATH/OUTPUT_{tx_digest}_{unix_timestamp}.json` instead. Use [speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/) to inspect the profile.

To install speedscope run

```

    
    
    npm install -g speedscope
```

To open a profile in speedscope run

```

    
    
    speedscope <PATH/PROFILE-OUTPUT-FILE>
```

When looking at the profile in speedscope, there are three different views available from the top left menu: **Timer Order** , **Left Heavy** , and **Sandwich**. In each view, each bar's vertical width corresponds to the percentage of gas consumption incurred by the function, and you can hover your mouse over a bar or click a bar to see the computation units accrued by the function invocation. The transaction's total computation units, along with the storage computation units, are multiplied by the gas price to determine the gas cost of the transaction based on a tier system.

**Time Order** shows the callstack of function invocations from left to right in the order of invocation, while **Left Heavy** combines repeated sequences of nested invocations into a single combined call stack. **Left Heavy** displays these sequences from left to right by total incurred gas consumption per combined call stack. This is useful when there have been hundreds of repeated calls to the same function to quickly observe the total gas consumption over all calls to that function. In both these views, you can click the top section and drag to zoom in and out over different sections of the profile.

**Sandwich** view shows a list of discrete values that correspond to gas consumption per function, with **Total** showing gas cost incurred in all the functions called by the function, and **Self** showing the gas cost done by only the given function.

Observing a transaction's gas consumption provides useful insight of expected gas cost usage of a smart contract. When developing a smart contract, you can [run a local network](/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network) and publish the package to the local network. Then create a transaction that calls your published smart contract, and finally run the profiler on the transaction to see a breakdown of the gas cost.

## Publish a Move package[​](#publish-a-move-package "Direct link to Publish a Move package")

One of the main uses of the `sui client` command is to publish smart contracts on the Sui network. This example switches the current environment to the Devnet network, then builds, tests, and publishes one of the existing Move examples available in the Sui repository: [sui/examples/move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/move)

This example also makes use of `sui move` commands. To learn more about those commands, see [Sui Move CLI](/references/cli/move).

  1. Open a terminal or console to the root of your local Sui repository and navigate to the `move_tutorial` example. 

```

    
        cd examples/movecd first_package
```

  2. Switch to the Devnet network. This command uses an alias, so the `devnet` value might be different for you, depending on the alias name set in your configuration (use `sui client envs` for a list of your defined networks and their aliases). 

```

    
        sui client switch --env devnet
```

  3. Use `sui move build` to build the package. You must run this command at the same level as the package manifest file ([Move.toml](https://move-book.com/concepts/manifest.html)). The console responds with the status of the build. 

```

    
        sui move buildINCLUDING DEPENDENCY SuiINCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlibBUILDING first_package
```

  4. Use `sui move test` to run the unit tests. The console responds with updates of its progress. 

```

    
        sui move testINCLUDING DEPENDENCY SuiINCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlibBUILDING first_packageRunning Move unit tests[ PASS  ] 0x0::example::test_module_init[ PASS  ] 0x0::example::test_sword_transactionsTest result: OK. Total tests: 2; passed: 2; failed: 0
```

  5. Use the `sui client verify-bytecode-meter` to check if the module passes the bytecode meter. The console responds with the maximum allowed values, as well as the amount the package uses. 

```

    
        $ sui client verify-bytecode-meterRunning bytecode verifier for 1 modules╭──────────────────────────────────╮│ Module will pass metering check! │├────────┬────────────┬────────────┤│    │ Module   │ Function  ││ Max  │ 16000000  │ 16000000  ││ Used  │ 4565    │ 4565    │╰────────┴────────────┴────────────╯
```

  6. Use `sui client gas` to verify that the active address has a gas coin for paying gas. In the case of this example, the console responds with the information that the address is coinless. 

```

    
        $ sui client gasNo gas coins are owned by this address
```

  7. If you need coins, use `sui client faucet` (not available for Mainnet). For more information on getting gas tokens, see [Get Sui Tokens](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins). 

```

    
        $ sui client faucet
```

  8. Use `sui client gas` to verify the current active address received the coins. 

```

    
        $ sui client gas╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────╮│ gasCoinId                           	  │ gasBalance │├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────┤│ 0x01b2795ba5800c8f7cb7d7c56abe19e24c656ed6764f3ccc5e66da3de52402a8 │ 10000000000 │╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────╯
```

  9. Use `sui client publish` to publish the package, being sure to set an appropriate value for the `gas-budget` flag. The console responds with the details of the publish. You can use `sui client object <OBJECT-ID>` to check the details of any of the objects from the process. 

```

    
        $ sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000 .

## Help[​](#help "Direct link to Help")

Each command has its own help section. For example, `sui client call --help` displays the following prompt:

```

# ptb
# Sui Client PTB CLI

The `client ptb` command allows you to specify the transactions for execution in a programmable transaction block (PTB) directly from your CLI or through bash scripts.

## Commands[​](#commands "Direct link to Commands")

The following list itemizes all the available args for the `sui client ptb` command. Use the `--help` for a long help version that includes some examples on how to use this command.

```

    
    
    Build, preview, and execute programmable transaction blocks. Depending on your shell, you might have to use quotes around arrays or other passed values. Use --help to see examples for how to use the core functionality of thiscommand.Usage: sui client ptb [OPTIONS]Options:   --assign <NAME> <VALUE>     Assign a value to a variable name to use later in the PTB.      If only a name is supplied, the result of the last transaction is bound to that name.      If a name and value are supplied, then the name is bound to that value.     Examples:      --assign MYVAR 100      --assign X [100,5000]      --split-coins gas [1000, 5000, 75000]      --assign new_coins # bound new_coins to the result of previous transaction   --dry-run     Perform a dry run of the PTB instead of executing it.   --gas-coin <ID>     The object ID of the gas coin to use. If not specified, it will try to use the first gas coin that it finds that has at least the requested gas-budget balance.   --gas-budget <MIST>     An optional gas budget for this PTB (in MIST). If gas budget is not provided, the tool will first perform a dry run to estimate the gas cost, and then it will execute the transaction. Please note that this incurs a small     cost in performance due to the additional dry run call.   --make-move-vec <TYPE> <[VALUES]>     Given n-values of the same type, it constructs a vector. For non objects or an empty vector, the type tag must be specified.     Examples:      --make-move-vec <u64> []      --make-move-vec <u64> [1, 2, 3, 4]      --make-move-vec <std::option::Option<u64>> [none,none]      --make-move-vec <sui::coin::Coin<sui::sui::SUI>> [gas]   --merge-coins <INTO_COIN> <[COIN OBJECTS]>     Merge N coins into the provided coin.     Examples:      --merge-coins @coin_object_id [@coin_obj_id1, @coin_obj_id2]   --move-call <PACKAGE::MODULE::FUNCTION> <TYPE_ARGS> <FUNCTION_ARGS>     Make a move call to a function.

## Design philosophy and concepts[​](#design-philosophy-and-concepts "Direct link to Design philosophy and concepts")

The main philosophy behind the CLI PTB support is to enable a user to build and execute a PTB from the command line. Bash scripts can be used to construct and execute the PTB just as you would do from the command line, providing great flexibility when it comes to automating different tasks.

Besides using existing [traditional PTB](/concepts/transactions/prog-txn-blocks/) related concepts, we introduce a few new and important concepts for this command.

warning

All the following examples were tested using a `bash` shell environment and your experience may vary depending on how your shell interprets the input values (e.g., zsh requires to pass values in brackets by adding quotes around it: "[]"; bash accepts them without quotes).

### Types[​](#types "Direct link to Types")

Sometimes, CLI PTBs require that you specify the type of a value or variable. For instance, in the following example you must provide the `<u64>` type when calling the `0x1::option::is_none` function.

```

    
    
    sui client ptb \--assign my_variable none \--move-call 0x1::option::is_none "<u64>" my_variable \--gas-budget 50000000
```

To pass in multiple types, delimit them with a comma:

```

    
    
    ...--move-call package::module::function "<u64,u8,u256>" \...
```

### Strings[​](#strings "Direct link to Strings")

CLI PTBs support string literals as inputs, which will be encoded as pure values that can be used as inputs to `vector<u8>`, `std::ascii::String` and `std::string::String` parameters. The following example previews a transaction block that passes the string `"Hello, world"` to a function `m::f` in a package `$PKG` (its ID is held in an environment variable).

```

    
    
    sui client ptb --move-call "$PKG::m::f" '"Hello, world"' --gas-budget 10000000 --preview
```

warning

Double-quoted string literals tend to also be valid syntax for shells (like `bash`), so when inputting PTBs on the command-line, remember to wrap the entire string in single-quotes so that its double-quotes are interpreted literally, as in the previous example.

### Addresses and Object IDs[​](#addresses-and-object-ids "Direct link to Addresses and Object IDs")

You can pass literal addresses and objects IDs by prefixing them with '@'. This is needed to distinguish a hexadecimal value from an address in some situations.

For addresses that are in your local wallet, you can use their alias instead (passing them without '@', for example, --transfer-objects my_alias).

Here are some examples for `transfer-objects` and `gas-coin`:

```

    
    
    sui client ptb --transfer-objects [ARRAY_OF_OBJECTS] @0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e591bd9d636e7895dcfc8de05f331 --gas-coin @0x00002819ee07a66e53800495ccf5eeade8a02054a2e0827546c70e4b226f0495
```

### Assign[​](#assign "Direct link to Assign")

Use the `--assign` argument to bind values to variables. There are two ways you can use it:

  * assign a value to a variable
  * assign a variable to the result of the previous command

Let's look at the first case where you assign a value to a variable. You want to check if some variable's value is `none`. Call the `0x1::option::is_none` function from the Move standard library, and pass in the variable name:

```

    
    
    sui client ptb \--assign my_variable none \--move-call 0x1::option::is_none "<u64>" my_variable \--gas-budget 50000000
```

tip

CLI PTB uses name resolution for common packages like `sui`, `std`, `deepbook`, so you can use them directly instead of their addresses: `0x2`, `0x1`, or `0xdee9`.

In the second case, if a previous command outputs some result, you can bound it to a variable for later access. Let's see an example where you want a new coin with 1000 MIST, which you can achieve by using the `split-coins` command. After you do that, you want to transfer the new coin to another address. Without the `--assign` argument, you couldn't instruct the CLI to transfer that new coin object as you would not have a way to refer to it.

```

    
    
    sui client ptb \--split-coins gas [1000] \--assign coin \--transfer-objects [coin] @recipient_address \--gas-budget 50000000
```

tip

If you build a complex PTB, use the `--preview` flag to display the PTB transaction list instead of executing it.

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

The following examples demonstrate how to use the `client ptb` command.

tip

When a PTB is executed, the output contains all the relevant information (transaction data, gas cost, effects, object changes, and so on). Use `--summary` to get a short summary when you do not need all the data. For complex PTBs, you can use `--preview` to display the PTB transaction list instead of executing it.

### Move call[​](#move-call "Direct link to Move call")

When needing to execute a Move call, use the `--move-call` transaction to call a specific function from a package. The CLI PTB supports name resolution for common packages like `sui`, `std`, `deepbook`, so you can use both `0x1::option::is_none` as well as `std::option::is_none` for passing the function name.

```

    
    
    --assign A none--move-call std::option::is_none "<u64>" A
```

To call a specific function from a specific package, you can use the following call:

```

    
    
    --move-call PACKAGE_ADDR::MODULE::FUNCTION "<TYPE>" FUNC_ARG1 FUNC_ARG2 ...
```

### Publish[​](#publish "Direct link to Publish")

Publishing a package is one of the most important commands you need when working with Sui. While the CLI has a standalone `publish` command, PTBs also support publishing and upgrading packages. One main difference is that with `sui client ptb`, you must explicitly transfer the `UpgradeCap` object that is returned when creating a package, or destroy it with a call to [`make_immutable`](/concepts/sui-move-concepts/packages). Here is an example on how to publish a Move project on chain using the `sui client ptb` command. It makes a call to the `sui::tx_context::sender` to acquire the sender and assigns the result of that call to the `sender` variable, and then calls the publish command. The result of `publish` is bounded to `upgrade_cap` variable, and then this object is transferred to the sender.

```

    
    
    sui client ptb \--move-call sui::tx_context::sender \--assign sender \--publish "." \--assign upgrade_cap \--transfer-objects [upgrade_cap] sender \--gas-budget 100000000
```

### Split, destroy, and merge coins[​](#split-destroy-and-merge-coins "Direct link to Split, destroy, and merge coins")

The following example showcases how to split a gas coin into multiple coins, make a move call to destroy one or more of the new coins, and finally merge the coins that were not destroyed back into the gas coin. It also showcases how to use framework name resolution (for example, `sui::coin` instead of `0x2::coin`) and how to refer to different values in an array using the `.` syntax.

```

    
    
    # Split off from gas--split-coins gas [0,1,2,3]--assign coins--move-call sui::coin::destroy_zero<sui::sui::SUI> coins.0# Can further split a split coin (and through variable bindings/result accesses)--split-coins coins.1 [0,0]--assign zcoins# Destroy both new coins--move-call sui::coin::destroy_zero<sui::sui::SUI> zcoins.0--move-call sui::coin::destroy_zero<sui::sui::SUI> zcoins.1# Can merge the split coins back--merge-coins gas [coins.1, coins.2, coins.3]--gas-budget 10000000
```

### Transfer objects[​](#transfer-objects "Direct link to Transfer objects")

This example creates three new coins from gas and transfers them to a different address.

```

    
    
    --assign to_address @0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e591bd9d636e7895dcfc8de05f331 \--split-coins gas [1,2,3] \--assign s \--transfer-objects [s.0, s.1, s.2] to_address \--gas-budget 10000000
```

info

You can also pass an alias (without the '@') instead of an address.

## Reserved words[​](#reserved-words "Direct link to Reserved words")

You cannot use the following words for variable names:

  * `address`
  * `bool`
  * `vector`
  * `some`
  * `none`
  * `gas`
  * `u8`
  * `u16`
  * `u32`
  * `u64`
  * `u128`
  * `u256`

## JSON output[​](#json-output "Direct link to JSON output")

Append the `--json` flag to commands to format responses in JSON instead of the more human-friendly default Sui CLI output. This can be useful for extremely large datasets, for example, as those results can have a troublesome display on smaller screens. In these cases, the `--json` flag is useful.

# keytool
# Sui Keytool CLI

The Sui CLI `keytool` command provides several command-level access for the management and generation of addresses, as well as working with private keys, signatures, or zkLogin. For example, a user could export a private key from the Sui Wallet and import it into the local Sui CLI wallet using the `sui keytool import [...]` command.

## Check Sui CLI installation[​](#check-sui-cli-installation "Direct link to Check Sui CLI installation")

Before you can use the Sui CLI, you must install it. To check if the CLI exists on your system, open a terminal or console and type the following command:

```

    
    
    sui --version
```

If the terminal or console responds with a version number, you already have the Sui CLI installed.

If the command is not found, follow the instructions in [Install Sui](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) to get the Sui CLI on your system.

## JSON output[​](#json-output "Direct link to JSON output")

Append the `--json` flag to commands to format responses in JSON instead of the more human friendly default Sui CLI output. This can be useful for extremely large datasets, for example, as those results can have a troublesome display on smaller screens. In these cases, the `--json` flag is useful.

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

The following examples demonstrate some of the most often used commands.

### List the key pairs in the local wallet[​](#list-the-key-pairs-in-the-local-wallet "Direct link to List the key pairs in the local wallet")

Use the `sui keytool list` command to output all the Sui addresses that exist in the `~/.sui/sui_config/sui.keystore` file in a readable format.

### Generate a new key pair and store it in a file[​](#generate-a-new-key-pair-and-store-it-in-a-file "Direct link to Generate a new key pair and store it in a file")

To generate a new key pair with the `ed25519` scheme, use the `sui keytool generate ed25519` command. For other schemes, see `sui keytool generate –help`.

# move
# Sui Move CLI

The Sui CLI `move` command provides several commands for working with Move source code. A typical usage of `sui move` is to compile and test the Move code, or to generate a new Move project by using `sui move new project_name`, which creates the needed directories and the `Move.toml` file.

## Check Sui CLI installation[​](#check-sui-cli-installation "Direct link to Check Sui CLI installation")

Before you can use the Sui CLI, you must install it. To check if the CLI exists on your system, open a terminal or console and type the following command:

```

    
    
    sui --version
```

If the terminal or console responds with a version number, you already have the Sui CLI installed.

If the command is not found, follow the instructions in [Install Sui](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) to get the Sui CLI on your system.

## Commands[​](#commands "Direct link to Commands")

Typing `sui move --help` into your terminal or console displays the following information on available commands.

```

    
    
    Usage: sui move [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>Commands: build coverage 	 Inspect test coverage for this package. A previous test run with the `--coverage` flag must have previously been run disassemble manage-package Record addresses (Object IDs) for where this package is published on chain (this command sets variables in Move.lock) migrate     Migrate to Move 2024 for the package at `path`. If no path is provided defaults to current directory new       Create a new Move package with name `name` at `path`. If `path` is not provided the package will be created in the directory `name` test   	 Run Move unit tests in this package help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)Options: -p, --path <PACKAGE_PATH>         	Path to a package which the command should be run with respect to -d, --dev                 	Compile in 'dev' mode. The 'dev-addresses' and 'dev-dependencies' fields will be used if this flag is set. This flag is useful for                      	development of packages that expose named addresses that are not set to a specific value 	--test                	Compile in 'test' mode. The 'dev-addresses' and 'dev-dependencies' fields will be used along with any code in the 'tests' directory 	--doc                 	Generate documentation for packages 	--abi                 	Generate ABIs for packages 	--install-dir <INSTALL_DIR>      	Installation directory for compiled artifacts. Defaults to current directory 	--force                	Force recompilation of all packages 	--fetch-deps-only           	Only fetch dependency repos to MOVE_HOME 	--skip-fetch-latest-git-deps     	Skip fetching latest git dependencies 	--default-move-flavor <DEFAULT_FLAVOR>	Default flavor for move compilation, if not specified in the package's config 	--default-move-edition <DEFAULT_EDITION> Default edition for move compilation, if not specified in the package's config 	--dependencies-are-root        	If set, dependency packages are treated as root packages. Notably, this will remove warning suppression in dependency packages -h, --help                	Print help -V, --version               	Print version
```

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

The following examples demonstrate some of the most often used commands.

### Create a new Move project[​](#create-a-new-move-project "Direct link to Create a new Move project")

To create a new Move project that automatically adds the necessary dependencies in a `Move.toml` file, run `sui move new [<PROJECT-NAME>]`.

```

    
    
    $ sui move new smart_contract_test$ ls -l smart_contract_testMove.tomlSources# display the contents of Move.toml file$ cat smart_contract_test/Move.toml[package]name = "smart_contract_test"version = "0.0.1"[dependencies]Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "framework/testnet" }[addresses]smart_contract_test = "0x0"
```

### Build a Move project[​](#build-a-move-project "Direct link to Build a Move project")

Use `sui move build` at the root of your Move project to build the package.

```

    
    
    $ sui move buildUPDATING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.gitINCLUDING DEPENDENCY SuiINCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlibBUILDING smart_contract_test
```

### Run tests in a Move project[​](#run-tests-in-a-move-project "Direct link to Run tests in a Move project")

Use `sui move test` to run the tests in a Move package.

```

    
    
    $ sui move testUPDATING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.gitINCLUDING DEPENDENCY SuiINCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlibBUILDING smart_contract_testRunning Move unit testsTest result: OK. Total tests: 0; passed: 0; failed: 0
```

### Get test coverage for a module[​](#get-test-coverage-for-a-module "Direct link to Get test coverage for a module")

caution

This command currently only works on debug builds of the CLI. Please build the CLI from source to use it.

This example uses [`first_package`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/move/first_package) Move package.

To get the a summary of the test coverage, you must first run the `sui move test --coverage` command, and then the `sui move coverage summary --test` to get a summary of the test coverage in the example project.

```

    
    
    $ sui move test --coverageINCLUDING DEPENDENCY SuiINCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlibBUILDING first_packageRunning Move unit tests[ PASS  ] 0x0::example::test_module_init[ PASS  ] 0x0::example::test_sword_transactionsTest result: OK.

```

## Help[​](#help "Direct link to Help")

Each command has its own help section. For example `sui move build –help` displays the following prompt:

```

    
    
    $ sui move build --helpUsage: sui move build [OPTIONS]Options: -p, --path <PACKAGE_PATH>         	Path to a package which the command should be run with respect to 	--with-unpublished-dependencies    	Include the contents of packages in dependencies that haven't been published (only relevant when dumping bytecode as base64) -d, --dev                 	Compile in 'dev' mode. The 'dev-addresses' and 'dev-dependencies' fields will be used if this flag is set. This flag is useful for development                      	of packages that expose named addresses that are not set to a specific value 	--dump-bytecode-as-base64       	Whether we are printing in base64 	--generate-struct-layouts       	If true, generate struct layout schemas for all struct types passed into `entry` functions declared by modules in this package These layout                      	schemas can be consumed by clients (e.g., the TypeScript SDK) to enable serialization/deserialization of transaction arguments and events 	--test                	Compile in 'test' mode. The 'dev-addresses' and 'dev-dependencies' fields will be used along with any code in the 'tests' directory 	--doc                 	Generate documentation for packages 	--lint                	If `true`, enable linters 	--abi                 	Generate ABIs for packages 	--install-dir <INSTALL_DIR>      	Installation directory for compiled artifacts.

# rust-sdk
# Rust SDK

The Sui Rust SDK crate is in the [**crates\sui-sdk** directory](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-sdk) of the Sui repository.

This crate provides the Sui Rust SDK, containing APIs to interact with the Sui network. Auto-generated documentation for this crate is [here](https://mystenlabs.github.io/sui/sui_sdk/index.html).

## Getting started[​](#getting-started "Direct link to Getting started")

Add the `sui-sdk` dependency as following:

```

    
    
    sui_sdk={git="https://github.com/mystenlabs/sui",package="sui-sdk"}tokio={version="1.2",features=["full"]}anyhow="1.0"
```

The main building block for the Sui Rust SDK is the `SuiClientBuilder`, which provides a simple and straightforward way of connecting to a Sui network and having access to the different available APIs.

In the following example, the application connects to the Sui `testnet` and `devnet` networks and prints out their respective RPC API versions.

```

    
    
    usesui_sdk::SuiClientBuilder;#[tokio::main]asyncfnmain()->Result<(),anyhow::Error>{// Sui testnet -- https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443let sui_testnet =SuiClientBuilder::default().build_testnet().await?;println!("Sui testnet version: {}", sui_testnet.api_version());// Sui devnet -- https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443let sui_devnet =SuiClientBuilder::default().build_devnet().await?;println!("Sui devnet version: {}", sui_devnet.api_version());Ok(())}
```

## Documentation for sui-sdk crate[​](#documentation-for-sui-sdk-crate "Direct link to Documentation for sui-sdk crate")

[GitHub Pages](https://mystenlabs.github.io/sui/sui_sdk/index.html) hosts the generated documentation for all Rust crates in the Sui repository.

### Building documentation locally[​](#building-documentation-locally "Direct link to Building documentation locally")

You can also build the documentation locally. To do so,

  1. Clone the `sui` repo locally. Open a Terminal or Console and go to the `sui/crates/sui-sdk` directory.

  2. Run `cargo doc` to build the documentation into the `sui/target` directory. Take note of location of the generated file from the last line of the output, for example `Generated /Users/foo/sui/target/doc/sui_sdk/index.html`.

  3. Use a web browser, like Chrome, to open the `.../target/doc/sui_sdk/index.html` file at the location your console reported in the previous step.

## Rust SDK examples[​](#rust-sdk-examples "Direct link to Rust SDK examples")

The [examples](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-sdk/examples) folder provides both basic and advanced examples.

There are serveral files ending in `_api.rs` which provide code examples of the corresponding APIs and their methods. These showcase how to use the Sui Rust SDK, and can be run against the Sui testnet. Below are instructions on the prerequisites and how to run these examples.

### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Unless otherwise specified, most of these examples assume `Rust` and `cargo` are installed, and that there is an available internet connection. The examples connect to the Sui testnet (`https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443`) and execute different APIs using the active address from the local wallet. If there is no local wallet, it will create one, generate two addresses, set one of them to be active, and it will request 1 SUI from the testnet faucet for the active address.

### Running the existing examples[​](#running-the-existing-examples "Direct link to Running the existing examples")

In the root folder of the `sui` repository (or in the `sui-sdk` crate folder), you can individually run examples using the command `cargo run --example filename` (without `.rs` extension). For example:

  * `cargo run --example sui_client` -- this one requires a local Sui network running (see [here](#Connecting to Sui Network )). If you do not have a local Sui network running, please skip this example.
  * `cargo run --example coin_read_api`
  * `cargo run --example event_api` -- note that this will subscribe to a stream and thus the program will not terminate unless forced (Ctrl+C)
  * `cargo run --example governance_api`
  * `cargo run --example read_api`
  * `cargo run --example programmable_transactions_api`
  * `cargo run --example sign_tx_guide`

### Basic Examples[​](#basic-examples "Direct link to Basic Examples")

#### Connecting to Sui Network[​](#connecting-to-sui-network "Direct link to Connecting to Sui Network")

The `SuiClientBuilder` struct provides a connection to the JSON-RPC server that you use for all read-only operations. The default URLs to connect to the Sui network are:

  * Local: <http://127.0.0.1:9000>
  * Devnet: <https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443>
  * Testnet: <https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443>
  * Mainnet: <https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443>

For all available servers, see [here](https://sui.io/networkinfo).

For running a local Sui network, please follow [this guide](https://docs.sui.io/build/sui-local-network) for installing Sui and [this guide](https://docs.sui.io/build/sui-local-network#start-the-local-network) for starting the local Sui network.

```

    
    
    usesui_sdk::SuiClientBuilder;#[tokio::main]asyncfnmain()->Result<(),anyhow::Error>{let sui =SuiClientBuilder::default().build("http://127.0.0.1:9000")// local network address.await?;println!("Sui local network version: {}", sui.api_version());// local Sui network, like the above one but using the dedicated functionlet sui_local =SuiClientBuilder::default().build_localnet().await?;println!("Sui local network version: {}", sui_local.api_version());// Sui devnet -- https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443let sui_devnet =SuiClientBuilder::default().build_devnet().await?;println!("Sui devnet version: {}", sui_devnet.api_version());// Sui testnet -- https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443let sui_testnet =SuiClientBuilder::default().build_testnet().await?;println!("Sui testnet version: {}", sui_testnet.api_version());Ok(())}
```

#### Read the total coin balance for each coin type owned by this address[​](#read-the-total-coin-balance-for-each-coin-type-owned-by-this-address "Direct link to Read the total coin balance for each coin type owned by this address")

```

    
    
    usestd::str::FromStr;usesui_sdk::types::base_types::SuiAddress;usesui_sdk::{SuiClientBuilder};#[tokio::main]asyncfnmain()->Result<(),anyhow::Error>{let sui_local =SuiClientBuilder::default().build_localnet().await?;println!("Sui local network version: {}", sui_local.api_version());let active_address =SuiAddress::from_str("<YOUR SUI ADDRESS>")?;// change to your Sui addresslet total_balance = sui_local.coin_read_api().get_all_balances(active_address).await?;println!("The balances for all coins owned by address: {active_address} are {}", total_balance);Ok(())}
```

## Advanced examples[​](#advanced-examples "Direct link to Advanced examples")

See the programmable transactions [example](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-sdk/examples/programmable_transactions_api.rs).

## Games examples[​](#games-examples "Direct link to Games examples")

### Tic Tac Toe quick start[​](#tic-tac-toe-quick-start "Direct link to Tic Tac Toe quick start")

  1. Prepare the environment

    1. Install `sui` binary following the [Sui installation](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install.mdx) docs.
    2. [Connect to Sui Devnet](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/guides/developer/getting-started/connect.mdx).
    3. [Make sure you have two addresses with gas](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/guides/developer/getting-started/get-address.mdx) by using the `new-address` command to create new addresses: 

```

        
                sui client new-address ed25519
    ```

You must specify the key scheme, one of `ed25519` or `secp256k1` or `secp256r1`. You can skip this step if you are going to play with a friend. :)
    4. [Request Sui tokens](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins.mdx) for all addresses that will be used to join the game.
  2. Publish the move contract

    1. [Download the Sui source code](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install.mdx).
    2. Publish the [`tic-tac-toe` package](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/tic-tac-toe/move) using the Sui client: 

```

        
                sui client publish --path /path-to-sui-source-code/examples/tic-tac-toe/move
    ```

    3. Record the package object ID.
  3. Create a new tic-tac-toe game

    1. Run the following command in the [`tic-tac-toe/cli` directory](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/tic-tac-toe/cli) to start a new game, replacing the game package objects ID with the one you recorded: 

```

        
                cargo run -- new --package-id <<tic-tac-toe package object ID>> <<player O address>>
    ```

This will create a game between the active address in the keystore, and the specified Player O.
    2. Copy the game ID and pass it to your friend to join the game.
  4. Making a move

Run the following command in the [`tic-tac-toe/cli` directory](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/tic-tac-toe/cli) to make a move in an existing game, as the active address in the CLI, replacing the game ID and address accordingly:

```

    
        cargo run -- move --package-id <<tic-tac-toe package object ID>> --row $R --col $C <<game ID>>
```

Move is an open source language for writing safe packages to manipulate on-chain objects (sometimes referred to as "smart contracts"). Move is a platform-agnostic language to enable common libraries, tooling, and developer communities across blockchains with vastly different data and execution models. Move is adaptable to meet the needs of the blockchain the code operates on, see [Move on Sui](/concepts/sui-move-concepts#differences) to review enhancements made to Move for optimization on the Sui blockchain.

# framework
# Sui Framework

The documentation in this section is created from the Rust `cargo doc` process. The process builds the content from comments in the source code.

## Framework documentation[​](#framework-documentation "Direct link to Framework documentation")

The child pages to this topic describe the module members for the following libraries:

## [🗃️ Deepbook7 items](/references/framework/deepbook)## [🗃️ Move Stdlib9 items](/references/framework/move-stdlib)## [🗃️ Sui Framework52 items](/references/framework/sui-framework)## [🗃️ Sui System11 items](/references/framework/sui-system)

## Source code[​](#source-code "Direct link to Source code")

You can find the source code for these Move modules in the [crates/sui-framework/packages](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-framework/packages) directory in the `sui` repository on GitHub. As previously mentioned, the comments included in the code provide context for the logic defined.

## Crate documentation[​](#crate-documentation "Direct link to Crate documentation")

You can review the raw `cargo doc` output of the following documentation in the `sui` repository. The .md files are located in the `crates/sui-framework/docs` directory. Online, they are located at <https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-framework/docs>.

## Build documentation locally[​](#build-documentation-locally "Direct link to Build documentation locally")

The most recent documentation is always available in the `main` branch of the `sui` repository. You shouldn't need to build the documentation locally, but if the need arises you can:

  1. Open a terminal or console to the `sui/crates/sui-framework` directory.
  2. Run `cargo doc --workspace --exclude "sui-benchmark" --no-deps`.
  3. The docs are built to `crates/sui-framework/docs` into their respective subdirectories.

info

If the `cargo doc` process does not work as expected, try running `cargo clean` before attempting again.

# sui-glossary
# Glossary

Find terms used in Sui defined below.

### Causal history[​](#causal-history "Direct link to Causal history")

Causal history is the relationship between an object in Sui and its direct predecessors and successors. This history is essential to the causal order Sui uses to process transactions. In contrast, other blockchains read the entire state of their world for each transaction, introducing latency.

### Causal order[​](#causal-order "Direct link to Causal order")

[Causal order](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/causal-ordering/) is a representation of the relationship between transactions and the objects they produce, laid out as dependencies. Validators cannot execute a transaction dependent on objects created by a prior transaction that has not finished. Rather than total order, Sui uses causal order (a partial order).

### Certificate[​](#certificate "Direct link to Certificate")

A certificate is the mechanism proving a transaction was approved or certified. Validators vote on transactions, and aggregators collect a Byzantine-resistant-majority of these votes into a certificate and broadcasts it to all Sui validators, thereby ensuring finality.

### Epoch[​](#epoch "Direct link to Epoch")

Operation of the Sui network is temporally partitioned into non-overlapping, fixed-duration epochs. During a particular epoch, the set of validators participating in the network is fixed.

### Equivocation[​](#equivocation "Direct link to Equivocation")

Equivocation in blockchains is the malicious action of dishonest actors giving conflicting information for the same message, such as inconsistent or duplicate voting.

### Eventual consistency[​](#eventual-consistency "Direct link to Eventual consistency")

[Eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) is the consensus model employed by Sui; if one honest validator certifies the transaction, all of the other honest validators will too eventually.

### Finality[​](#finality "Direct link to Finality")

[Finality](https://medium.com/mechanism-labs/finality-in-blockchain-consensus-d1f83c120a9a) is the assurance a transaction will not be revoked. This stage is considered closure for an exchange or other blockchain transaction.

### Gas[​](#gas "Direct link to Gas")

[Gas](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) refers to the computational effort required for executing operations on the Sui network. In Sui, gas is paid with the network's native currency SUI. The cost of executing a transaction in SUI units is referred to as the transaction fee.

### Genesis[​](#genesis "Direct link to Genesis")

Genesis is the initial act of creating accounts and gas objects for a Sui network. Sui provides a `genesis` command that allows users to create and inspect the genesis object setting up the network for operation.

### Multi-writer objects[​](#multi-writer-objects "Direct link to Multi-writer objects")

Multi-writer objects are objects that are owned by more than one address. Transactions affecting multi-writer objects require consensus in Sui. This contrasts with transactions affecting only single-writer objects, which require only a confirmation of the owner's address contents.

### Object[​](#object "Direct link to Object")

The basic unit of storage in Sui is object. In contrast to many other blockchains, where storage is centered around address and each address contains a key-value store, Sui's storage is centered around objects. Sui objects have one of the following primary states:

  * _Immutable_ - the object cannot be modified.
  * _Mutable_ - the object can be changed.

Further, mutable objects are divided into these categories:

  * _Owned_ - the object can be modified only by its owner.
  * _Shared_ - the object can be modified by anyone.

Immutable objects do not need this distinction because they have no owner.

### Proof-of-stake[​](#proof-of-stake "Direct link to Proof-of-stake")

[Proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) is a blockchain consensus mechanism where the voting weights of validators or validators is proportional to a bonded amount of the network's native currency (called their stake in the network). This mitigates [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) by forcing bad actors to gain a large stake in the blockchain first.

### Single-writer objects[​](#single-writer-objects "Direct link to Single-writer objects")

Single-writer objects are owned by one address. In Sui, transactions affecting only single-writer objects owned by the same address may proceed with only a verification of the sender's address, greatly speeding transaction times. These are _simple transactions_. See Single-Writer Apps for example applications of this simple transaction model.

### Smart contract[​](#smart-contract "Direct link to Smart contract")

A [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) is an agreement based upon the protocol for conducting transactions in a blockchain. In Sui, smart contracts are written in the [Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move) programming language.

### Sui[​](#sui "Direct link to Sui")

Sui refers to the Sui blockchain, and the [Sui open source project](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/) as a whole.

### SUI[​](#sui-1 "Direct link to SUI")

SUI is the native token to the Sui network.

### Total order[​](#total-order "Direct link to Total order")

[Total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order) refers to the ordered presentation of the history of all transactions processed by a traditional blockchain up to a given time. This is maintained by many blockchain systems, as the only way to process transactions. In contrast, Sui uses a causal (partial) order wherever possible and safe.

### Transaction[​](#transaction "Direct link to Transaction")

A transaction in Sui is a change to the blockchain. This may be a _simple transaction_ affecting only single-writer, single-address objects, such as minting an NFT or transferring an NFT or another token. These transactions may bypass the consensus protocol in Sui.

More _complex transactions_ affecting objects that are shared or owned by multiple addresses, such as asset management and other DeFi use cases, do go through consensus.

### Transfer[​](#transfer "Direct link to Transfer")

A transfer is switching the owner address of a token to a new one via command in Sui. This is accomplished via the Sui CLI client command line interface. It is one of the more common of many commands available in the CLI client.

### Validator[​](#validator "Direct link to Validator")

A validator in Sui plays a passive role analogous to the more active role of validators and minors in other blockchains. In Sui, validators do not continuously participate in the consensus protocol but are called into action only when receiving a transaction or certificate.

# contribution-process
# Contribute to Sui Documentation

As open source software, Sui depends on community contributions. This page covers the process for contributing to Sui's documentation.

To make changes to the documentation, you can fork and clone the Sui repository to your local machine and make changes from your preferred IDE of choice, or by the web interface on GitHub. This guide covers both scenarios.

## Style guide compliance[​](#style-guide-compliance "Direct link to Style guide compliance")

All changes to the documentation must follow the [style guide](/style-guide), as well as the review process and information on the editors throughout the process. Do not be offended by the number of change requests your docs PR might receive. This is not a reflection on your writing abilities, but an effort to keep a consistent tone across the documentation set. Depending on reviewer and workload, some reviews are more thorough than others. After your PR merges, your content might be changed at a later date to align better with Sui writing standards.

To create more engaging content, be sure to follow these rules in particular:

  * Always prefer [active voice](/style-guide#active-voice).
  * [Present tense](/style-guide#present-tense) verbs are almost always the right choice.
  * Be [concise](/style-guide#general-considerations). Use only the words strictly necessary to convey an idea.

## Set up local environment[​](#local-environment "Direct link to Set up local environment")

Cloning the documentation locally is recommended when you are creating larger, more significant changes to the docs. See [Sui Environment Setup](/references/contribute/sui-environment) for instructions on forking the Sui repository, if necessary. The documentation is in the `docs/content` directory.

  1. If you are using the recommended Visual Studio Code IDE, install [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to ensure that your formatting is consistent.
  2. After you make all your changes, stage all files with changes (`git add .` to add all modified files), create a local commit (`git commit -m “message”`), and then push all your changes to your forked repository (`git push`).
  3. To view your changes via `localhost`, enter `pnpm install` into a terminal at the `docs/site` directory to install dependencies, then `pnpm start` to view the changes on `localhost:3000` to ensure that the website works as intended. You might need to [install the `pnpm` package manager](https://pnpm.io/installation) if you don't already have it.

## For beginners[​](#for-beginners "Direct link to For beginners")

Editing the documentation via the GitHub web interface is recommended if you are not familiar with working in an IDE, or for smaller changes and fixes.

**Add New Page**

Navigate to the `docs/content` directory, then navigate to the appropriate subdirectory and click the `Add file` button in the top-right. Select `create new file` to create a new file and edit it directly on GitHub's web interface.

**Change Existing Page**

To change an existing page, navigate to the file you want to edit, click on the pencil icon in the top-right, and edit your changes there.

## Review process[​](#review-process "Direct link to Review process")

When you are finished creating your changes in your own fork or using the web interface, submit a PR to the Sui repository. When you do so, you can view the deployment on Vercel and double-check that everything behaves the way you intend. For every unique commit in a PR, Vercel generates a new preview. A reviewer then takes responsibility for providing clear and actionable feedback to your PR. As the owner of the PR, it is your responsibility to modify your PR to address the feedback that has been provided to you by the reviewer. Keep in mind that you may receive feedback from multiple reviewers. After a reviewer has approved your PR, it is merged into `main` and your contributions are made public.

# graphql-rpc
# GraphQL for Sui RPC (Beta)

⚙️Beta Feature

This content describes a beta feature or service. Beta features and services are in active development, so details are likely to change.

This feature or service is currently available in

  * Devnet
  * Testnet
  * Mainnet

This section explains some of the common concepts when working with GraphQL, such as altering behavior using HTTP headers, re-using query snippets with variables and fragments, consuming paginated queries, and understanding and working within the limits enforced by the service.

Jump to the following sections for more details:

For more details on GraphQL fundamentals, see the introductory documentation from [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/introduction-to-graphql).

## Headers[​](#headers "Direct link to Headers")

The service accepts the following optional headers:

  * `x-sui-rpc-version` to specify which RPC version to use (currently only one version is supported),
  * `x-sui-rpc-show-usage` returns the response with extra query complexity information.

By default, each request returns the service's version in the response header: `x-sui-rpc-version`.

```

    
    
    curl -i -X POST https://sui-mainnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql \   --header 'x-sui-rpc-show-usage: true'         \   --header 'Content-Type: application/json'       \   --data '{     "query": "query { epoch { referenceGasPrice } }"   }'
```

The response for the previous request looks similar to the following:

```

    
    
    HTTP/2 200content-type: application/jsoncontent-length: 159x-sui-rpc-version: 2024.1.0date: Tue, 30 Jan 2024 23:50:43 GMTvia: 1.1 googlealt-svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000{ "data": {  "epoch": {   "referenceGasPrice": "1000"  } }, "extensions": {  "usage": {   "inputNodes": 2,   "outputNodes": 2,   "depth": 2,   "variables": 0,   "fragments": 0,   "queryPayload": 37  } }}
```

## Variables[​](#variables "Direct link to Variables")

Variables offer a way to introduce dynamic inputs to a re-usable/static query. Declare variables in the parameters to a `query` or `mutation`, using the `$` symbol and its type (in this example `Int`), which must be a `scalar`, `enum`, or `input` type. In the query body, refer to it by its name (prefixed with the `$` symbol).

If you declare a variable but don't use it or define it (supply a value) in the query, the query fails to execute.

To learn more, read the GraphQL documentation on [Variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables).

In the following example, a variable supplies the ID of the epoch being queried.

```

    
    
    query($epochID:Int){epoch(id:$epochID){referenceGasPrice}}
```

**Variables** :

```

    
    
    {"epochID":100}
```

### In the IDE[​](#in-the-ide "Direct link to In the IDE")

When using the online IDE, supply variables as a JSON object to the query in the **Variables** pane at the bottom of the main editing window. You receive a warning if you supply a variable but don't declare it.

### In requests[​](#in-requests "Direct link to In requests")

When making a request to the GraphQL service (for example, using `curl`), pass the query and variables as two fields of a single JSON object:

```

    
    
     curl -X POST https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql \  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \  --data '{   "query": "query ($epochID: Int) { epoch(id: $epochID) { referenceGasPrice } }",   "variables": { "epochID": 100 }  }'
```

## Fragments[​](#fragments "Direct link to Fragments")

Fragments are reusable units that you can include in queries as needed. To learn more, consult the official GraphQL [documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments). The following example uses fragments to factor out a reusable snippet representing a Move value.

```

    
    
    queryDynamicField{object(address:"0xb57fba584a700a5bcb40991e1b2e6bf68b0f3896d767a0da92e69de73de226ac"){dynamicField(name:{type:"0x2::kiosk::Listing",bcs:"NLArx1UJguOUYmXgNG8Pv8KbKXLjWtCi6i0Yeq1VhfwA",}){...DynamicFieldSelect}}}fragmentDynamicFieldSelectonDynamicField{name{...MoveValueFields}value{...DynamicFieldValueSelection}}fragmentDynamicFieldValueSelectiononDynamicFieldValue{__typename...onMoveValue{...MoveValueFields}...onMoveObject{hasPublicTransfercontents{...MoveValueFields}}}fragmentMoveValueFieldsonMoveValue{type{repr}databcs}
```

## Pagination[​](#pagination "Direct link to Pagination")

GraphQL supports queries that fetch multiple kinds of data, potentially nested. For example, the following query retrieves the first 20 transaction blocks (along with the digest, the sender's address, the gas object used to pay for the transaction, the gas price, and the gas budget) after a specific transaction block at epoch `97`.

```

    
    
    query{epoch(id:97){transactionBlocks(first:10){pageInfo{hasNextPageendCursor}nodes{digestsender{address}effects{gasEffects{gasObject{address}}}gasInput{gasPricegasBudget}}}}}
```

If there are too many transactions to return in a single response, the service applies a [limit](#limits) on the maximum page size for variable size responses (like the `transactionBlock` query) and you must fetch further results through [pagination](https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/).

### Connections[​](#connections "Direct link to Connections")

Fields that return a paginated response accept at least the following optional parameters:

  * `first`, a limit on page size that is met by dropping excess results from the end.
  * `after`, a cursor that bounds the results from below, exclusively.
  * `last`, a limit on page size that is met by dropping excess results from the start.
  * `before`, a cursor that bounds the results from above, exclusively.

They also return a type that conforms to the [GraphQL Cursor Connections Specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm), meaning its name ends in `Connection`, and it contains at least the following fields:

  * `pageInfo`, of type [PageInfo](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/objects/page-info), which indicates whether there are more pages before or after the page returned.
  * `nodes`, the content of the paginated response, as a list of the type being paginated (`TransactionBlock` in the previous example).
  * `edges`, similar to `nodes` but associating each node with its [cursor](#cursors).

### Cursors[​](#cursors "Direct link to Cursors")

Cursors are opaque identifiers for paginated results. The only valid source for a cursor parameter (like `after` and `before`) is a cursor field from a previous paginated response (like `PageInfo.startCursor`, `PageInfo.endCursor`, or `Edge.cursor`). The underlying format of the cursor is an implementation detail, and is not guaranteed to remain fixed across versions of the GraphQL service, so do not rely on it -- generating cursors out of thin air is not expected or supported.

Cursors are used to bound results from below (with `after`) and above (with `before`). In both cases, the bound is exclusive, meaning it does not include the result that the cursor points to in the bounded region.

#### Consistency[​](#consistency "Direct link to Consistency")

Cursors also guarantee **consistent** pagination. If the first paginated query reads the state of the network at checkpoint `X`, then a future call to fetch the next page of results using the cursors returned by the first query continues to read from the network at checkpoint `X`, even if data for future checkpoints is now available.

This property requires that cursors that are used together (for example when supplying an `after` and `before` bound) are fixed on the same checkpoint, otherwise the query produces an error.

#### Available range[​](#available-range "Direct link to Available range")

The GraphQL service does not support consistent pagination for arbitrarily old cursors. A cursor can grow stale, if the checkpoint it is from is no longer in the **available range**. You can query the upper- and lower-bounds of that range as follows:

```

    
    
    {availableRange{first{sequenceNumber}last{sequenceNumber}}}
```

The results are the first and last checkpoint for which pagination continues to work and produce a consistent result. At the time of writing the available range offers a 5- to 15-minute buffer period to finish pagination.

### Page limits[​](#page-limits "Direct link to Page limits")

After results are bounded using cursors, a page size limit is applied using the `first` and `last` parameters. The service requires these parameters to be less than or equal to the max page size [limit](#limits), and if you provide neither, it selects a default. In addition to setting a limit, `first` and `last` control where excess elements are discarded from. For example, if there are `10` potential results -- `R0`, `R1`, ..., `R9` -- after cursor bounds have been applied, then

  * a limit of `first: 3` would select `R0`, `R1`, `R2`, and
  * a limit of `last: 3` would select `R7`, `R8`, `R9`.

info

It is an error to apply both a `first` and a `last` limit.

### Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

To see these principles put into practice, consult the examples for [paginating forwards](/guides/developer/getting-started/graphql-rpc#page-forward) and [paginating backwards](/guides/developer/getting-started/graphql-rpc#page-back) in the getting started guide.

## Limits[​](#limits "Direct link to Limits")

The GraphQL service for Sui RPC is rate-limited on all available instances to keep network throughput optimized and to protect against excessive or abusive calls to the service.

### Rate limits[​](#rate-limits "Direct link to Rate limits")

Queries are rate-limited at the number of attempts per minute to ensure high availability of the service to all users.

### Query limits[​](#query-limits "Direct link to Query limits")

In addition to rate limits, queries are also validated against a number of rules on their complexity, such as the number of nodes, the depth of the query, or their payload size. Query the `serviceConfig` field to retrieve these limits. An example of how to query for some of the available limits follows:

```

    
    
    {serviceConfig{maxQueryDepthmaxQueryNodesmaxOutputNodesmaxDbQueryCostdefaultPageSizemaxPageSizerequestTimeoutMsmaxQueryPayloadSizemaxTypeArgumentDepthmaxTypeArgumentWidthmaxTypeNodesmaxMoveValueDepth}}
```

# object-model
# Object Model

The basic unit of storage in Sui is the object. In contrast to many other blockchains where storage is centered around accounts containing key-value stores, Sui's storage is centered around objects addressable on-chain by unique IDs. A smart contract is an object (called a Sui Move package), and these smart contracts manipulate objects on the Sui network:

  * Sui Move Package: a set of Sui Move bytecode modules. Each module has a name that's unique within the containing package. The combination of the package's on-chain ID and the name of a module uniquely identify the module. When you publish smart contracts to Sui, a package is the unit of publishing. After you publish a package object, it is immutable and can never be changed or removed. A package object can depend on other package objects that were previously published to Sui.
  * Sui Move Object: typed data governed by a particular Sui Move module from a Sui Move package. Each object value is a struct with fields that can contain primitive types (such as integers and addresses), other objects, and non-object structs.

## Object metadata[​](#object-metadata "Direct link to Object metadata")

Each Sui object has the following metadata:

  * A 32-byte globally unique ID. An object ID is derived from the digest of the transaction that created the object and from a counter encoding the number of IDs generated by the transaction.
  * An 8-byte unsigned integer version that monotonically increases with every transaction that modifies it (see [Object and Package Versioning](/concepts/versioning)).
  * A 32-byte transaction digest indicating the last transaction that included this object as an output.
  * A 32-byte owner field that indicates how this object can be accessed. See [Object Ownership](/concepts/object-ownership) for more information.

In addition to common metadata, objects have a category-specific, variable-sized contents field containing a [Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS)](https://docs.rs/bcs/latest/bcs/)-encoded payload.

  * Move Objects contain their Move type, whether the object can be transferred using `public_transfer`, and its fields, again encoded as BCS.
  * Move Packages contain the bytecode modules in the package, a table identifying which versions of a package introduced each of its types (the type origin table), and a table mapping each of its transitive dependencies to a specific version of that package to use (the linkage table).

## Referring to objects[​](#referring-to-objects "Direct link to Referring to objects")

There are a few different ways to concisely refer to an object without specifying its entire contents and metadata, each with slightly different use cases:

  * **ID:** the globally unique ID of the object mentioned above. ID is a stable identifier for the object across time and is useful for querying the current state of an object or describing which object was transferred between two addresses.
  * **Versioned ID:** an (ID, version) pair. Versioned ID describes the state of the object at a particular point in the object's history and is useful for asking what the value of the object was at some point in the past or determining how fresh some view of an object is now.
  * **Object Reference:** an (ID, version, object digest) triple. The object digest is the hash of the object's contents and metadata. An object reference provides an authenticated view of the object at a particular point in the object's history. Transactions require object inputs to be specified via object references to ensure the transaction's sender and a validator processing the transaction agree on the contents and metadata of the object.

## The transaction-object DAG: Relating objects and transactions[​](#the-transaction-object-dag-relating-objects-and-transactions "Direct link to The transaction-object DAG: Relating objects and transactions")

Transactions take objects as input, read/write/mutate these inputs, and produce mutated or freshly created objects as output. Each object knows the (hash of the) last transaction that produced it as an output. Thus, a natural way to represent the relationship between objects and transactions is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where:

  * Nodes are transactions.
  * Directed edges go from transaction `A` to transaction `B` if an output object of `A` is an input object of `B`. They are labeled by the reference of the object in question (which specifies the exact version of the object created by `A` and used by `B`).

The root of this DAG is a genesis transaction that takes no inputs and produces the objects that exist in the system's initial state. The DAG can be extended by identifying mutable transaction outputs that have not yet been consumed by any committed transaction and sending a new transaction that takes these outputs (and optionally, immutable transaction outputs) as inputs.

The set of objects that are available to be taken as input by a transaction are the live objects, and the global state maintained by Sui consists of the totality of such objects. The live objects for a particular Sui address A are all objects owned by A, along with all shared and immutable objects in the system.

When this DAG contains all committed transactions in the system, it forms a complete (and cryptographically auditable) view of the system's state and history. In addition, you can use the scheme above to construct a DAG of the relevant history for a subset of transactions or objects (for example, the objects owned by a single address).

## Limits on transactions, objects, and data[​](#limits-on-transactions-objects-and-data "Direct link to Limits on transactions, objects, and data")

Sui has some limits on transactions and data used in transactions, such as a maximum size and number of objects used. For more information on limits, see [Building against Limits](https://move-book.com/guides/building-against-limits.html) in The Move Book.

The `ProtocolConfig` struct in the [`sui-protocol-config` crate](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-protocol-config/src/lib.rs) itemizes these limits. Expand the following code to see the `ProtocolConfig` struct and the comments that explain each parameter.

    /// Constants that change the behavior of the protocol.////// The value of each constant here must be fixed for a given protocol version. To change the value/// of a constant, advance the protocol version, and add support for it in `get_for_version` under/// the new version number./// (below).////// To add a new field to this struct, use the following procedure:/// - Advance the protocol version./// - Add the field as a private `Option<T>` to the struct./// - Initialize the field to `None` in prior protocol versions./// - Initialize the field to `Some(val)` for your new protocol version./// - Add a public getter that simply unwraps the field./// - Two public getters of the form `field(&self) -> field_type`///   and `field_as_option(&self) -> Option<field_type>` will be automatically generated for you./// Example for a field: `new_constant: Option<u64>`/// ```rust,ignore///   pub fn new_constant(&self) -> u64 {///     self.new_constant.expect(Self::CONSTANT_ERR_MSG)///   }///   pub fn new_constant_as_option(&self) -> Option<u64> {///     self.new_constant.expect(Self::CONSTANT_ERR_MSG)///   }/// ```/// With `pub fn new_constant(&self) -> u64`, if the constant is accessed in a protocol version/// in which it is not defined, the validator will crash.

# Transactions

All updates to the Sui database happen via transactions. This topic describes the transaction types supported by Sui and explains how their execution changes the ledger. There are only two kinds of transactions on Sui:

  * Programmable transaction blocks, which anyone can submit on the network. For information on these transactions, see [Programmable Transaction Blocks](/concepts/transactions/prog-txn-blocks).
  * System transactions, which only validators can directly submit and are responsible for keeping the network running (changing epochs, starting checkpoints, and so on).

## Transaction metadata[​](#transaction-metadata "Direct link to Transaction metadata")

All Sui transactions have the following common metadata:

  * **Sender address:** The [address](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-address) of the user sending this transaction.
  * **Gas input:** An object reference pointing to the object that will be used to pay for this transaction's execution and storage. This object must be owned by the user and must be of type `sui::coin::Coin<SUI>` (i.e., the Sui native currency).
  * **Gas price:** An unsigned integer specifying the number of native tokens per gas unit this transaction will pay. The gas price must always be nonzero.
  * **Maximum gas budget:** The maximum number of gas units that can be expended by executing this transaction. If this budget is exceeded, transaction execution will abort and have no effects other than debiting the gas input object. Consequently, the gas input object must have a value higher than the gas price multiplied by the max gas, and this product is the maximum amount that the gas input object will be debited for the transaction.
  * **Epoch:** The Sui epoch this transaction is intended for.
  * **Type:** A call, publish, or native transaction and its type-specific-data (see below).
  * **Authenticator:** A cryptographic signature and a public key that both verifies against the signature and is cryptographically committed to by the sender address.
  * **Expiration:** An epoch reference that sets a deadline after which validators will no longer consider the transaction valid. The optional expiration epoch reference enables users to define transactions that either execute and commit by a set time (current epoch less than or equal to expiration epoch), or never execute after the deadline passes. By default, there is no deadline for when a transaction must execute.

## Transactions flow - example[​](#transactions-flow---example "Direct link to Transactions flow - example")

Here's an example showing how objects and transactions are connected to each other in Sui.

In the following example there are two objects:

  * Object A is a coin of type SUI with a total balance of 5 SUI
  * Object B with 2 SUI coins that belongs to John

Tom decides to send 1 SUI coin to Alice. In this case, Object A is the input to this transaction and 1 SUI coin is debited from this object. The output of the transaction is two objects:

  * Object A with 4 SUI coins that still belongs to Tom
  * new created Object C with 1 SUI coin that belongs now to Alice

At the same time, John decides to send 2 SUI coins to Anna. Because the relationship between objects and transactions is written in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and both transactions interact with different objects, this transaction executes in parallel with the transaction that sends coins from Tom to Alice. This transaction changes only the owner of Object B from John to Anna.

After receiving 2 SUI coins, Anna sent them immediately to Tom. Now Tom has 6 SUI coins (4 from Object A and 2 from Object B).

Finally, Tom sends all of his SUI coins to John. For this transaction, the input is actually two objects (Object A and Object B). Object B is destroyed, and its value is added to Object A. As a result, the transaction's output is only Object A with a value of 6 SUI.

## Limits on transactions, objects, and data[​](#limits-on-transactions-objects-and-data "Direct link to Limits on transactions, objects, and data")

Sui has some limits on transactions and the data used in them, such as a maximum size and number of objects used. You can find these limits in the [`sui-protocol-config` crate](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-protocol-config/src/lib.rs) of the Sui repo. The limits are defined in the `ProtocolConfig` struct and values set in the `get_for_version_impl` function.

# Querying Sui RPC with GraphQL

The quickest way to access the GraphQL service for Sui RPC is through the online IDE that provides a complete toolbox for fetching data and executing transactions on the network. The online IDE provides features such as auto-completion (use Ctrl+Space or just start typing), built-in documentation (Book icon, top-left), multi-tabs, and more.

The online IDE is available for [Mainnet](https://sui-mainnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) and [Testnet](https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql). This guide contains various queries that you can try directly in the IDE.

info

  * Any existing addresses/object IDs in these examples refer to `mainnet` data only.
  * Both [mainnet](https://sui-mainnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) and [testnet](https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) services are rate-limited to keep network throughput optimized.

For more details about some concepts used in the examples below, please see the [GraphQL concepts](/concepts/graphql-rpc) page, and consult the [reference](/references/sui-graphql) for full documentation on the supported schema.

## Discovering the schema[​](#discovering-the-schema "Direct link to Discovering the schema")

GraphQL introspection exposes the schema supported by the RPC service. The IDE's "Docs" pane (Book icon, top-left) and Search dialog (`Cmd`+`K` on macOS or `Ctrl`+`K` on Windows and Linux) offer a way to browse introspection output interactively.

The [official documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) provides an overview on introspection, and how to interact with it programmatically.

## Finding the reference gas price for latest epoch[​](#finding-the-reference-gas-price-for-latest-epoch "Direct link to Finding the reference gas price for latest epoch")

```

    
    
    query{epoch{referenceGasPrice}}
```

## Finding information about a specific historical epoch[​](#finding-information-about-a-specific-historical-epoch "Direct link to Finding information about a specific historical epoch")

This example finds the total stake rewards, the reference gas price, the number of checkpoints and the total gas fees for epoch 100. Note that in the query, the `id` argument is optional, and defaults to the latest epoch.

```

    
    
    query{epoch(id:100)# note that id is optional, and without it, latest epoch is returned{epochIdtotalStakeRewardsreferenceGasPricetotalCheckpointstotalGasFeestotalStakeSubsidiesstorageFund{totalObjectStorageRebatesnonRefundableBalance}}}
```

## Finding a transaction block by its digest[​](#finding-a-transaction-block-by-its-digest "Direct link to Finding a transaction block by its digest")

This example gets a transaction block by its digest and shows information such as the gas sponsor's address, the gas price, the gas budget, and effects from executing that transaction block.

```

    
    
    query{transactionBlock(digest:"FdKFgsQ9iRrxW6b1dh9WPGuNuaJWMXHJn1wqBQSqVqK2"){gasInput{gasSponsor{address}gasPricegasBudget}effects{statustimestampcheckpoint{sequenceNumber}epoch{epochIdreferenceGasPrice}}}}
```

## Finding the last ten transactions that are not a system transaction[​](#finding-the-last-ten-transactions-that-are-not-a-system-transaction "Direct link to Finding the last ten transactions that are not a system transaction")

```

    
    
    query{transactionBlocks(last:10,filter:{kind:PROGRAMMABLE_TX}){nodes{digestkind{__typename}}}}
```

## Finding all transactions that touched a given object[​](#finding-all-transactions-that-touched-a-given-object "Direct link to Finding all transactions that touched a given object")

This example finds all the transactions that touched (modified/transferred/deleted) a given object. This is useful for when we want to trace the flow of a Coin/StakeSui/NFT.

info

This example uses GraphQL [variables](/concepts/graphql-rpc#variables) and [pagination](/concepts/graphql-rpc#pagination). When using the online IDE, copy the variables JSON to the "Variables" window, below the main editor.

```

    
    
    query($objectID:SuiAddress!){transactionBlocks(filter:{changedObject:$objectID}){nodes{sender{address}digesteffects{objectChanges{nodes{address}}}}}}
```

**Variables** :

```

    
    
    {"objectID":"0x11c6ae8432156527fc2e12e05ac7db79f2e972510a823a4ef2e670f27ad7b52f"}
```

## Filtering transaction blocks by a function[​](#filtering-transaction-blocks-by-a-function "Direct link to Filtering transaction blocks by a function")

This example finds the last ten transaction blocks that called the `public_transfer` function, (as a move call transaction command).

info

This example makes usage of the filter `last`, which indicates that the user only wants the last ten transaction blocks known to the service.

```

    
    
    {transactionBlocks(last:10,filter:{function:"0x2::transfer::public_transfer"}){nodes{digest}}}
```

## Finding transaction balance changes[​](#finding-transaction-balance-changes "Direct link to Finding transaction balance changes")

This example finds the balance changes of all the transactions where a given address called a staking-related function. This is useful when you want to get your staking or unstaking history.

```

    
    
    query($address:SuiAddress!){transactionBlocks(filter:{function:"0x3::sui_system::request_add_stake"sentAddress:$address}){nodes{digesteffects{balanceChanges{nodes{owner{address}amount}}}}}}
```

**Variables** :

```

    
    
    {"address":"0xa9ad44383140a07cc9ea62d185c12c4d9ef9c6a8fd2f47e16316229815862d23"}
```

## Fetching a dynamic field on an object[​](#fetching-a-dynamic-field-on-an-object "Direct link to Fetching a dynamic field on an object")

info

This example uses aliases and [fragments](/concepts/graphql-rpc#fragments).

```

    
    
    queryDynamicField{object(address:"0xb57fba584a700a5bcb40991e1b2e6bf68b0f3896d767a0da92e69de73de226ac"){dynamicField(name:{type:"0x2::kiosk::Listing",bcs:"NLArx1UJguOUYmXgNG8Pv8KbKXLjWtCi6i0Yeq1VhfwA",}){...DynamicFieldSelect}}}fragmentDynamicFieldSelectonDynamicField{name{...MoveValueFields}value{...DynamicFieldValueSelection}}fragmentDynamicFieldValueSelectiononDynamicFieldValue{__typename...onMoveValue{...MoveValueFields}...onMoveObject{hasPublicTransfercontents{...MoveValueFields}}}fragmentMoveValueFieldsonMoveValue{type{repr}databcs}
```

## Fetching all dynamic fields on an object[​](#fetching-all-dynamic-fields-on-an-object "Direct link to Fetching all dynamic fields on an object")

This query can be used to paginate over the dynamic fields of an object. This works even when the object in question is [wrapped](/concepts/object-ownership/wrapped), by using the [owner](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/queries/owner) query, so can be used for iterating over the elements of on-chain data structures, like [Tables and Bags](/concepts/dynamic-fields/tables-bags).

info

This example uses [fragments](/concepts/graphql-rpc#fragments) and [variables](/concepts/graphql-rpc#variables).

```

    
    
    query($id:SuiAddress!){owner(address:$id){dynamicFields{nodes{name{...Value}value{__typename...onMoveValue{...Value}...onMoveObject{contents{...Value}}}}}}}fragmentValueonMoveValue{type{repr}json}
```

## Paginating checkpoints forward, five at a time[​](#page-forward "Direct link to Paginating checkpoints forward, five at a time")

```

    
    
    query($after:String){checkpoints(first:5,after:$after){pageInfo{hasNextPageendCursor}nodes{digesttimestamp}}}
```

Sets up a paginated query, starting at the genesis checkpoint, reading five checkpoints at a time, in increasing order of sequence number. The value of `pageInfo.hasNextPage` determines whether there is another page to be read, and the value of `pageInfo.endCursor` is fed back in as the cursor to read `$after`.

info

This example uses GraphQL [variables](/concepts/graphql-rpc#variables) and [pagination](/concepts/graphql-rpc#pagination).

## Paginating checkpoints backwards, five at a time[​](#page-back "Direct link to Paginating checkpoints backwards, five at a time")

```

    
    
    query($before:String){checkpoints(last:5,before:$before){pageInfo{hasPreviousPagestartCursor}nodes{digesttimestamp}}}
```

Sets up a paginated query, starting at the latest indexed checkpoint, reading five checkpoints at a time, in decreasing order of sequence number. The value of `pageInfo.hasPreviousPage` determines whether there is another page to be read, and the value of `pageInfo.startCursor` is fed back in as the cursor to read `$before`.

info

This example uses GraphQL [variables](/concepts/graphql-rpc#variables) and [pagination](/concepts/graphql-rpc#pagination).

## Executing a transaction[​](#executing-a-transaction "Direct link to Executing a transaction")

Transaction execution takes in two arguments, `txBytes` and `signatures`. `txBytes` is the serialized unsigned transaction data, which can be generated when using the Sui CLI's `client call` [command](/references/cli/client), to call a Move function by passing the `--serialize-unsigned-transaction` flag. The `signatures` can be generated using Sui CLI's [keytool](/references/cli/keytool) command `sui keytool sign`. More information on Sui CLI can be found [here](/references/cli).

```

    
    
    mutation($tx:String!,$sigs:[String!]!){executeTransactionBlock(txBytes:$tx,signatures:$sigs){errorseffects{statusepoch{startTimestamp}gasEffects{gasSummary{computationCost}}}}}
```

# graphql-migration
# Migrating to GraphQL (Beta)

⚙️Beta Feature

This content describes a beta feature or service. Beta features and services are in active development, so details are likely to change.

This feature or service is currently available in

  * Devnet
  * Testnet
  * Mainnet

This guide compares JSON-RPC queries to their equivalent GraphQL counterpart. While it is possible to systematically rewrite JSON-RPC queries (for example, `sui_getTotalTransactionBlocks`) to their GraphQL counterparts using this guide, it is recommended that you revisit your application's query patterns to take full advantage of the flexibility that GraphQL offers in serving queries that touch multiple potentially nested endpoints (for example transactions, balances, coins), and use the following examples to get a flavor of how the two APIs express similar concepts.

For a comprehensive list of all available GraphQL features, consult the [reference](/references/sui-graphql).

### Example 1: Get total transaction blocks[​](#example-1-get-total-transaction-blocks "Direct link to Example 1: Get total transaction blocks")

The goal is to get the total number of transaction blocks in the network.

  * JSON-RPC
  * GraphQL

```

    
    
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"sui_getTotalTransactionBlocks","params":[]}
```

```

    
    
    query{checkpoint{networkTotalTransactions}}
```

### Example 2: Get a specific transaction block[​](#example-2-get-a-specific-transaction-block "Direct link to Example 2: Get a specific transaction block")

The goal is to get the transaction block by its digest.

  * JSON-RPC
  * GraphQL

```

    
    
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"sui_getTransactionBlock","params":["Hay2tj3GcDYcE3AMHrej5WDsHGPVAYsegcubixLUvXUF",{"showInput":true,"showRawInput":false,"showEffects":true,"showEvents":true,"showObjectChanges":false,"showBalanceChanges":false}]}
```

```

    
    
    query{transactionBlock(digest:"Hay2tj3GcDYcE3AMHrej5WDsHGPVAYsegcubixLUvXUF"){gasInput{gasSponsor{address}gasPricegasBudget}effects{statustimestampcheckpoint{sequenceNumber}epoch{epochIdreferenceGasPrice}}}}
```

### Example 3: Get coin objects owned by an address[​](#example-3-get-coin-objects-owned-by-an-address "Direct link to Example 3: Get coin objects owned by an address")

The goal is to return all `Coin<0x2::sui::SUI>` objects an address owns.

  * JSON-RPC
  * GraphQL

```

    
    
    query {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"suix_getCoins","params":["0x5094652429957619e6efa79a404a6714d1126e63f551f4b6c7fb76440f8118c9",//owner"0x2::sui::SUI",//coin type"0xe5c651321915b06c81838c2e370109b554a448a78d3a56220f798398dde66eab",//cursor3//limit]}
```

```

    
    
    query{address(address:"0x5094652429957619e6efa79a404a6714d1126e63f551f4b6c7fb76440f8118c9"){coins(first:3,after:"IAB3ha2PEA4ESRF4UErsJufJEwYpmSbCq7UNpxIHnLhG",type:"0x2::sui::SUI"){nodes{address}}}}
```

info

The cursor is now passed in the `after` (or `before`) fields on the connection, and the limit in the `first` or `last` fields.

## New features[​](#new-features "Direct link to New features")

There are also things that GraphQL can do, which JSON-RPC cannot:

### Example 4: Getting objects by type[​](#example-4-getting-objects-by-type "Direct link to Example 4: Getting objects by type")

This query fetches the latest versions of objects of type `0x2::package::Publisher` that are currently live on-chain.

```

    
    
    query{objects(filter:{type:"0x2::package::Publisher"}){nodes{addressdigestasMoveObject{contents{json}}}}}
```

### Example 5: Paging through package versions[​](#example-5-paging-through-package-versions "Direct link to Example 5: Paging through package versions")

The goal is to find all versions of the Sui framework, and list their modules:

```

    
    
    query{packageVersions(address:"0x2"){nodes{versionmodules{nodes{name}}}}}
```

# gas-smashing
# Gas Smashing

Every transaction on Sui has a gas fee associated with its execution that must be paid to successfully execute the transaction. Gas smashing enables you to pay for this gas fee using multiple coins instead of just one. This mechanism is especially helpful in scenarios where you might have a number of coins with smaller denominations, or if you simply want to minimize the number of SUI coins under your account. Gas smashing is generally a useful tool for coin management, especially when coupled with the `GasCoin` programmable transaction block (PTB) argument.

## Smashing gas[​](#smashing-gas "Direct link to Smashing gas")

Gas smashing happens automatically in a transaction if you provide multiple coins to pay for the gas fee. When Sui executes a transaction, Sui combines, or "smashes", all of the coins you provide to pay for the gas into a single coin. The smashing occurs regardless of coin amounts or the gas budget provided with the transaction (as long as it is within the minimum and maximum gas budgets). Sui deducts the gas fee from the single coin regardless of the execution status of the transaction. In particular, this means that even if the transaction fails to execute for some reason (such as an execution error) the coins that you provided as gas coins remain smashed after the transaction's execution.

Gas smashing is an efficient way to perform coin management, and to combine many smaller coins into one single coin that you can use to not only pay for gas fees, but also for other operations in the transaction that smashes the coins. In particular, you can use gas smashing to combine multiple coins to pay for the gas fee of the PTB, and then that same PTB can withdraw from the `GasCoin`. A special argument is available in PTBs that references the coin used to pay gas after Sui deducts the gas fee from it, which you can use to transfer the remaining SUI to another address. Because gas smashing happens automatically in a transaction if you provide multiple gas coins, you can combine multiple coins as part of other transactions to perform coin management in parallel with non-coin-management specific transactions.

Sui has a maximum of 256 coins that you can smash in a single PTB - the transaction is not processed if the number of gas coins exceeds this amount. Additionally, when you smash gas coins, Sui deletes all but the first coin. Because of this, there is often a storage rebate associated with the deletion of these coins. As with other storage rebates, you can't use the resulting refund to pay for the gas fee of the transaction (and isn't credited to the coin until after the execution of the transaction), but it might result in a refund after the execution of the transaction. This refund, along with the remaining balance after the transaction's gas fee, resides in the first gas coin you provide in the transaction after execution.

## Running out of gas with a refund[​](#running-out-of-gas-with-a-refund "Direct link to Running out of gas with a refund")

Because coins are smashed regardless of the execution status, storage rebates can lead to seemingly odd cases where a transaction can both run out of gas and end up with a negative gas and storage fee (you get a refund from the transaction). As an example of how this might happen, take a transaction `T` that has a gas budget of `5000`, and you provide coins `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, `C4`, `C5` with values of `1000`, `2000`, `3000`, `4000`, and `5000` to pay for gas. If the storage rebate for a coin object is `2000`, and the gas fee for `T` execution is more than the provided gas budget of `5000` (so, `T` runs out of gas), this results in an execution status of `OutOfGas`. The `C1` coin has a balance of `1000` + `2000` + `3000` + `4000` + `5000` - `5000` + `2000` * `4` = `15000` - `5000` + `8000` = `18000` and `T` ends up with a negative gas and storage fee (a refund) of `3000`.

# dry-run-transaction-block
# dryRunTransactionBlock

Simulate running a transaction to inspect its effects without committing to them on-chain.

`txBytes` either a `TransactionData` struct or a `TransactionKind` struct, BCS-encoded and then Base64-encoded. The expected type is controlled by the presence or absence of `txMeta`: If present, `txBytes` is assumed to be a `TransactionKind`, if absent, then `TransactionData`.

`txMeta` the data that is missing from a `TransactionKind` to make a `TransactionData` (sender address and gas information). All its fields are nullable.

`skipChecks` optional flag to disable the usual verification checks that prevent access to objects that are owned by addresses other than the sender, and calling non-public, non-entry functions, and some other checks. Defaults to false.

# owner
# owner

Look up an Owner by its SuiAddress.

`rootVersion` represents the version of the root object in some nested chain of dynamic fields. It allows consistent historical queries for the case of wrapped objects, which don't have a version. For example, if querying the dynamic field of a table wrapped in a parent object, passing the parent object's version here will ensure we get the dynamic field's state at the moment that parent's version was created.

Also, if this Owner is an object itself, `rootVersion` will be used to bound its version from above when querying `Owner.asObject`. This can be used, for example, to get the contents of a dynamic object field when its parent was at `rootVersion`.

If `rootVersion` is omitted, dynamic fields will be from a consistent snapshot of the Sui state at the latest checkpoint known to the GraphQL RPC. Similarly, `Owner.asObject` will return the object's version at the latest checkpoint.

```

    
    
    owner(address:SuiAddress!rootVersion:UInt53):Owner
```

### Arguments[​](#arguments "Direct link to Arguments")

# package
# package

The package corresponding to the given address (at the optionally given version).

When no version is given, the package is loaded directly from the address given. Otherwise, the address is translated before loading to point to the package whose original ID matches the package at `address`, but whose version is `version`. For non-system packages, this might result in a different address than `address` because different versions of a package, introduced by upgrades, exist at distinct addresses.

Note that this interpretation of `version` is different from a historical object read (the interpretation of `version` for the `object` query).

# transaction-blocks
# transactionBlocks

The transaction blocks that exist in the network.

`scanLimit` restricts the number of candidate transactions scanned when gathering a page of results. It is required for queries that apply more than two complex filters (on function, kind, sender, recipient, input object, changed object, or ids), and can be at most `serviceConfig.maxScanLimit`.

When the scan limit is reached the page will be returned even if it has fewer than `first` results when paginating forward (`last` when paginating backwards). If there are more transactions to scan, `pageInfo.hasNextPage` (or `pageInfo.hasPreviousPage`) will be set to `true`, and `PageInfo.endCursor` (or `PageInfo.startCursor`) will be set to the last transaction that was scanned as opposed to the last (or first) transaction in the page.

Requesting the next (or previous) page after this cursor will resume the search, scanning the next `scanLimit` many transactions in the direction of pagination, and so on until all transactions in the scanning range have been visited.

By default, the scanning range includes all transactions known to GraphQL, but it can be restricted by the `after` and `before` cursors, and the `beforeCheckpoint`, `afterCheckpoint` and `atCheckpoint` filters.

# verify-zklogin-signature
# verifyZkloginSignature

Verify a zkLogin signature based on the provided transaction or personal message based on current epoch, chain id, and latest JWKs fetched on-chain. If the signature is valid, the function returns a `ZkLoginVerifyResult` with success as true and an empty list of errors. If the signature is invalid, the function returns a `ZkLoginVerifyResult` with success as false with a list of errors.

  * `bytes` is either the personal message in raw bytes or transaction data bytes in BCS-encoded and then Base64-encoded.
  * `signature` is a serialized zkLogin signature that is Base64-encoded.
  * `intentScope` is an enum that specifies the intent scope to be used to parse bytes.
  * `author` is the address of the signer of the transaction or personal msg.

```

> When the scan limit is reached the page will be returned even if it has fewer than `first` results when paginating forward (`last` when paginating backwards).

# change-epoch-transaction
# ChangeEpochTransaction

A system transaction that updates epoch information on-chain (increments the current epoch). Executed by the system once per epoch, without using gas. Epoch change transactions cannot be submitted by users, because validators will refuse to sign them.

This transaction kind is deprecated in favour of `EndOfEpochTransaction`.

# dynamic-field
# DynamicField

Dynamic fields are heterogeneous fields that can be added or removed at runtime, and can have arbitrary user-assigned names. There are two sub-types of dynamic fields:

  1. Dynamic Fields can store any value that has the `store` ability, however an object stored in this kind of field will be considered wrapped and will not be accessible directly via its ID by external tools (explorers, wallets, etc) accessing storage.
  2. Dynamic Object Fields values must be Sui objects (have the `key` and `store` abilities, and id: UID as the first field), but will still be directly accessible off-chain via their object ID after being attached.

```

    
    
    typeDynamicField{name:MoveValuevalue:DynamicFieldValue}

# epoch
# Epoch

Operation of the Sui network is temporally partitioned into non-overlapping epochs, and the network aims to keep epochs roughly the same duration as each other. During a particular epoch the following data is fixed:

  * the protocol version
  * the reference gas price
  * the set of participating validators

```

# immutable
# Immutable

An immutable object is an object that can't be mutated, transferred, or deleted. Immutable objects have no owner, so anyone can use them.

```

# owner
# Owner

An Owner is an entity that can own an object. Each Owner is identified by a SuiAddress which represents either an Address (corresponding to a public key of an account) or an Object, but never both (it is not known up-front whether a given Owner is an Address or an Object).

# parent
# Parent

If the object's owner is a Parent, this object is part of a dynamic field (it is the value of the dynamic field, or the intermediate Field object itself), and it is owned by another object.

Although its owner is guaranteed to be an object, it is exposed as an Owner, as the parent object could be wrapped and therefore not directly accessible.

> An immutable object is an object that can't be mutated, transferred, or deleted. Immutable objects have no owner, so anyone can use them.

#### [`ObjectOwner.**Shared**`](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/shared) object[​](#objectownershared- "Direct link to objectownershared-")

> A shared object is an object that is shared using the 0x2::transfer::share_object function. Unlike owned objects, once an object is shared, it stays mutable and is accessible by anyone.

#### [`ObjectOwner.**Parent**`](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/parent) object[​](#objectownerparent- "Direct link to objectownerparent-")

> If the object's owner is a Parent, this object is part of a dynamic field (it is the value of the dynamic field, or the intermediate Field object itself), and it is owned by another object.
> 
> Although its owner is guaranteed to be an object, it is exposed as an Owner, as the parent object could be wrapped and therefore not directly accessible.

#### [`ObjectOwner.**AddressOwner**`](/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/address-owner) object[​](#objectowneraddressowner- "Direct link to objectowneraddressowner-")

> An address-owned object is owned by a specific 32-byte address that is either an account address (derived from a particular signature scheme) or an object ID. An address-owned object is accessible only to its owner and no others.

# iowner
# IOwner

Interface implemented by GraphQL types representing entities that can own objects. Object owners are identified by an address which can represent either the public key of an account or another object. The same address can only refer to an account or an object, never both, but it is not possible to know which up-front.

```
